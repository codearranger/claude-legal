  This skill is a matter-neutral reference catalog for Colorado
  civil practice. It contains the C.R.C.P. (Colorado Rules of Civil
  Procedure) summary, the CRE (Colorado Rules of Evidence) summary,
  fees-and-costs framework under C.R.S. art. 16 of title 13, local
  rules and Chief Justice Directives, citation format per Colorado
  Appellate Court conventions, key general-civil cases, and the
  canonical online-sources catalog. Triggers include "Colorado civil
  rule", "C.R.C.P.", "CRE", "C.R.S. § 13-16", "Colorado citation
  format", "what's the Colorado rule on X", "look up Colorado law on
  X". Other skills cite this one for specific rule numbers and case
  authorities; the heavy reference corpora (court-rules, federal-debt-
  laws, ucc-model, co-statutes-debt) live in this skill's

## C.R.C.P. — Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure

The C.R.C.P. governs all civil proceedings in the Colorado district
courts. It is organized in three major chapters:

- **Chapter 1** (Rules 1-121) — district court rules
- **Chapter 18** (Rules 301-411) — county court civil rules
- **Chapter 25** (Rules 501-521) — small claims court

A streamlined parallel **Chapter 18** governs **county court**, which
follows the same general structure but with simplified procedures and
no presumptive C.R.C.P. 26(a)(1) initial disclosures.

Key rules every Colorado civil practitioner uses:

| Rule | Subject |
|------|---------|
| C.R.C.P. 4 | Process — summons and service |
| C.R.C.P. 5 | Service and filing of pleadings and other papers |
| C.R.C.P. 6 | Time computation |
| C.R.C.P. 8 | Pleading rules |
| C.R.C.P. 10 | Form of pleadings, motions, and other documents |
| C.R.C.P. 11 | Signing of pleadings (lawyer registration #) |
| C.R.C.P. 12 | Defenses and objections (answer due in 21 days) |
| C.R.C.P. 13 | Counterclaim and cross-claim |
| C.R.C.P. 15 | Amended and supplemental pleadings |
| C.R.C.P. 16 | Pretrial procedure — case management |
| C.R.C.P. 16.2 | Domestic relations case management |
| C.R.C.P. 26 | Discovery — disclosures and scope |
| C.R.C.P. 30 | Depositions |
| C.R.C.P. 33 | Interrogatories |
| C.R.C.P. 34 | Production of documents |
| C.R.C.P. 36 | Requests for admission |
| C.R.C.P. 37 | Motion to compel; sanctions |
| C.R.C.P. 41 | Dismissal of actions |
| C.R.C.P. 54 | Judgment |
| C.R.C.P. 55 | Default judgment |
| C.R.C.P. 56 | Summary judgment |
| C.R.C.P. 59 | Motion for new trial / amend findings |
| C.R.C.P. 60 | Relief from judgment |
| C.R.C.P. 121 | Local rules — statewide practice standards (the "Rule 121 sections" including § 1-15 motion practice) |

See `references/civil-rules.md` for a section-by-section summary.

## CRE — Colorado Rules of Evidence

The CRE closely mirrors the Federal Rules of Evidence with some
distinctive Colorado provisions:

| Rule | Subject |
|------|---------|
| CRE 101-106 | General provisions |
| CRE 201-203 | Judicial notice |
| CRE 301-302 | Presumptions |
| CRE 401-415 | Relevance and limitations (404(b) prior bad acts, 408 settlement, 411 insurance) |
| CRE 501-510 | Privileges (attorney-client, marital, journalist's shield under C.R.S. § 13-90-119) |
| CRE 601-615 | Witnesses |
| CRE 701-706 | Opinion and experts (Daubert-equivalent — CRE 702 reads like the post-2000 FRE 702) |
| CRE 801-807 | Hearsay (note the 803(6) business-records foundation and 902(11) self-authentication) |
| CRE 901-903 | Authentication |
| CRE 1001-1008 | Best evidence |

See `references/evidence-rules.md` for the section-by-section summary
and the Colorado distinctives from the FRE.

## Fees and costs — C.R.S. art. 16 of title 13

Colorado follows the **American rule** — each party bears its own
attorneys' fees unless a statute, rule, contract, or recognized
doctrine shifts. Common shifting authorities:

- **C.R.S. § 13-17-101 et seq.** — frivolous, groundless, vexatious
- **C.R.S. § 13-17.5-101 et seq.** — fees in prisoner litigation
- **C.R.S. § 13-16-122** — court costs allowable on judgment
- **C.R.S. § 13-16-104** — costs to prevailing party
- **C.R.S. § 6-1-113(2)(a)** — CCPA attorneys' fees mandatory to
  prevailing consumer
- **C.R.S. § 5-16-113(2)** — CFDCPA attorneys' fees
- **15 U.S.C. § 1692k(a)(3)** — FDCPA attorneys' fees
- **Contractual fee provisions** — enforceable but **reciprocal**
  under C.R.S. § 13-17-102 in some circumstances

See `references/fees-and-costs.md` for the full cost-shifting
framework.

## Citation format — Colorado Appellate Court conventions

Colorado uses a **public-domain neutral citation** for all Supreme
Court and Court of Appeals decisions issued after January 1, 2012,
in **parallel** with the West regional reporter:

- Colorado Supreme Court (post-2012): `People v. Smith, 2020 CO 12, ¶ 15, 456 P.3d 789`
- Colorado Supreme Court (pre-2012): `People v. Jones, 252 P.3d 1191, 1196 (Colo. 2011)`
- Colorado Court of Appeals (post-2012): `Smith v. Jones, 2019 COA 45, ¶ 22, 432 P.3d 100`
- Colorado Court of Appeals (pre-2012): `Smith v. Jones, 219 P.3d 1130 (Colo. App. 2009)`

The neutral citation format is `[YEAR] CO [###]` for the Supreme
Court and `[YEAR] COA [###]` for the Court of Appeals; cite to
paragraph numbers (`¶`) rather than page numbers since the neutral
citation is paragraph-anchored.

Federal-court conventions:

- Tenth Circuit: `Spann v. Carter, 23 F.4th 1131, 1135 (10th Cir. 2022)`
- D. Colo.: `Smith v. Jones, No. 22-cv-00123, 2023 WL 1234567 (D. Colo. Jan. 1, 2023)`

Statutes:

- Colorado statutes: `C.R.S. § 13-80-103.5(1)(a)` (always with §)
- C.R.C.P.: `C.R.C.P. 12(b)(5)` (no § for rules)
- CRE: `C.R.E. 803(6)` (use periods)
- Federal: `15 U.S.C. § 1692g(b)`
- C.F.R.: `12 C.F.R. § 1006.34`

See `references/citation-format.md` for the full conventions.

## Local rules — JD-specific

Beyond the statewide C.R.C.P. 121 "local rules," each judicial
district publishes its own administrative orders and local rules.
The most commonly cited:

- **2nd JD Admin. Order 23-XX** — Denver case management
- **18th JD Local Rules** — Arapahoe / Douglas / Elbert / Lincoln
- **4th JD Local Rules** — El Paso / Teller

Plus chambers-specific **practice standards** published by individual
judges. See `references/local-rules.md` for an index.

## Key cases — general civil

A short list of Colorado civil precedents every practitioner cites:

- *Parker v. Dist. Court for City & County of Denver*, 173 Colo. 537 (1971) — pro se construction
- *Garcia v. Schneider Energy Services, Inc.*, 2012 CO 62 — frivolous-claim sanctions
- *Pham v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.*, 2014 CO 53 — declaratory-judgment standards
- *Continental Air Lines v. Keenan*, 731 P.2d 708 (Colo. 1987) — at-will employment exception
- *Lewis v. Taylor*, 2016 CO 48 — economic-loss rule
- *Town of Alma v. AZCO Const., Inc.*, 10 P.3d 1256 (Colo. 2000) — economic-loss rule origins

See `references/key-cases.md` for the expanded list.
