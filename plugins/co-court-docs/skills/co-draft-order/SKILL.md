# Draft a Colorado Proposed Order

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** This skill scaffolds a proposed order. The
> filer is responsible for ensuring the order mirrors the relief
> sought in the underlying motion and contains nothing the court did
> not actually rule on.

Use this skill in addition to `co-statewide-format` when a motion or
stipulation requires a **Proposed Order** for the judge's signature.
Most Colorado motions must be accompanied by a proposed order under
C.R.C.P. 121 § 1-15(7).

## Cardinal rule — the proposed order mirrors the motion

The proposed order's relief should **mirror exactly** the relief
requested in the motion. Two failure modes:

- **Over-reaching**: ordering something the motion did not request —
  judges strike or modify these
- **Under-reaching**: omitting something the motion requested but
  the court might want to grant — leaves the order incomplete

Cross-check the prayer for relief in the motion (`WHEREFORE...`)
against the proposed order's ordering clause (`IT IS HEREBY
ORDERED...`) one item at a time.

## Standard proposed-order structure

```
                [Caption — exactly matching the motion]

           [DOCUMENT TITLE: ORDER ON DEFENDANT'S
              MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY]

THIS MATTER comes before the Court on Defendant's Motion to Compel
Discovery (the "Motion"), filed [date]. The Court has reviewed the
Motion, the Response (if any), the Reply (if any), the supporting
declarations and exhibits, and the case file.

The Court FINDS as follows:

1. [Finding 1, e.g., "Defendant timely served Plaintiff with its
   First Set of Interrogatories and Requests for Production on
   [date]."]

2. [Finding 2, e.g., "Plaintiff did not timely respond to
   Interrogatories Nos. 3, 5, and 7 or to Requests for Production
   Nos. 2 and 8."]

3. [Finding 3, e.g., "Defendant's counsel conferred with Plaintiff's
   counsel on [date] in compliance with C.R.C.P. 121 § 1-15(8)."]

4. [Finding 4, e.g., "Plaintiff's objections are without merit
   under C.R.C.P. 26(b)(5) because they lack the required
   particularity."]

The Court CONCLUDES that good cause exists to grant the Motion.

                            ORDER

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:

A. Defendant's Motion to Compel Discovery is GRANTED.

B. Plaintiff shall serve, within 14 days of this Order, full and
   complete responses to Defendant's Interrogatories Nos. 3, 5, and
   7 and Requests for Production Nos. 2 and 8, without objection.

C. Pursuant to C.R.C.P. 37(a)(5), Defendant is awarded its
   reasonable expenses incurred in bringing this Motion, including
   attorneys' fees, in the amount of $______. Defendant shall
   submit a fee affidavit within 14 days of this Order.

D. The Case Management Order entered [date] is amended as follows:
   [if applicable].

DATED this ___ day of __________, 20__.

                                        BY THE COURT:

                                        _____________________________
                                        [Judge's Name]
                                        District Court Judge
                                        [Division ##]
```

## Findings vs. order — keep them separate

Colorado judges expect a clear separation between **factual findings**
(numbered, neutrally stated) and **the ordering clause** (lettered
or numbered list of specific commands). Conflating the two — e.g.,
"Because Plaintiff failed to respond and Defendant is therefore
entitled to attorneys' fees, the Court orders..." — makes it harder
for the judge to delete a finding without invalidating an order.

## Default judgment order

For default judgments under C.R.C.P. 55(b), the proposed order
must include specific findings:

```
THIS MATTER comes before the Court on Plaintiff's Motion for
Entry of Default Judgment under C.R.C.P. 55(b)(2). Having reviewed
the file, the Court FINDS:

1. Defendant was personally served with the Summons and Complaint
   on [date] per the Return of Service filed [date].

2. Defendant has not filed an answer or other responsive pleading
   within the time allowed by C.R.C.P. 12(a).

3. The Clerk entered default under C.R.C.P. 55(a) on [date].

4. Plaintiff is entitled to judgment in the amount of $_____
   consisting of:
     a. Principal: $_____
     b. Pre-judgment interest at the statutory rate of [8% under
        C.R.S. § 5-12-102 / contract rate]: $_____
     c. Filing fee: $_____
     d. Service of process: $_____
     e. Other costs: $_____

5. Post-judgment interest will accrue at the statutory rate of 8%
   per annum under C.R.S. § 5-12-102 from the date of entry until
   paid.

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that judgment is entered in favor of Plaintiff
and against Defendant in the amount of $_____.
```

## Decree-form orders (family law)

Decrees of dissolution, legal separation, and declarations of
invalidity follow a longer structure with detailed findings on
jurisdiction, marriage, residency, marital property, debts,
maintenance, parental responsibilities, and child support. Use
**JDF 1116** (decree template) as the starting point. See
`co-family-law` for the substantive structure.

## Word-format chambers copy

In many Colorado JDs (especially the 18th JD and some Denver
divisions), the assigned judge requests an **editable Word-format**
proposed order emailed directly to chambers in addition to the PDF
filed through CCEFS. The Word copy lets the judge:

- Edit findings before signing
- Insert specific date or dollar fills
- Strike portions the court declines to grant

When the judge's practice standards call for a Word copy:

1. Save the proposed order as `.docx`
2. Email to chambers at `[division-name].chambers@judicial.state.co.us`
   or the address listed in the judge's practice standards
3. Subject line: `Proposed Order — [Case Short Title], Case No.
   [Number]`
4. Body: brief reference to the underlying motion and the CCEFS
   filing date
