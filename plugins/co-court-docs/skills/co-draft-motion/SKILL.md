# Draft a Colorado Motion

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** This skill scaffolds a draft motion. The
> filer is responsible for verifying the underlying law and the
> rule's applicability to the facts of the case.

Use this skill to produce a motion + supporting memorandum in
Colorado format. Most Colorado motions follow C.R.C.P. 121 § 1-15
(motion practice generally) plus the rule under which the motion is
filed (12(b)(5), 56, 60(b), 37(a), etc.).

## Page limits — C.R.C.P. 121 § 1-15(1)(a)

| Document | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| Motion / response | 15 pages |
| Reply | 10 pages |

Excess pages require **leave of court**, sought by separate motion.
Many divisions require a **chambers copy** for motions exceeding 20-25
pages — check the assigned judge's practice standards.

## Common motion types

| Motion | Rule | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Motion to Dismiss | C.R.C.P. 12(b)(5) | Plausibility standard under *Warne v. Hall*, 2016 CO 50; no conferral required |
| Motion for Summary Judgment | C.R.C.P. 56 | Must be filed >= 91 days before trial; affidavits showing no genuine issue of material fact |
| Motion to Compel | C.R.C.P. 37(a) | Conferral required (C.R.C.P. 121 § 1-15(8)); attach the deficient responses |
| Motion to Set Aside Default | C.R.C.P. 55(c) / 60(b) | Within 182 days for 60(b)(1)-(3); show good cause + meritorious defense |
| Motion for Reconsideration | C.R.C.P. 59 | Within 14 days of judgment |
| Motion in Limine | (inherent) | Pre-trial; addresses anticipated evidentiary disputes |

| Motion for Extension of Time | C.R.C.P. 6(b) | Conferral required; typically routine |

## Argument structure — the Parker approach

Pro se filers should follow the **pro-se drafting framework**:

1. **State the relief clearly** in the opening sentence
2. **Cite the rule or statute** that grants the court power to award
   that relief
3. **State the facts** that satisfy each element of the standard
4. **Apply the controlling case law** to those facts
5. **Conclude** with the specific order sought

A motion that hides the relief, buries the rule citation, or omits a
clear element-by-element factual showing is the kind of filing the
court will struggle to engage with — Parker requires liberal
construction, but the court will not draft the argument for you.

## Composition

- For format: `co-statewide-format`
- For the supporting declaration: `co-draft-declaration`
- For the proposed order: `co-draft-order`
- For setting the hearing: `co-schedule-hearing`, `co-draft-note`
- For the court overlay: `co-denver`, `co-arapahoe`,
  `co-county-courts`
- For pre-filing QC: `co-quality-check`, `co-fact-check`
- For deadline math: `co-deadlines`
