  Use this skill for FCRA strategy: proof of harm and propagating
  corrections. Triggers include "should I apply for credit",
  "generate a denial letter", "adverse action letter", "send
  corrected report to everyone", "soft vs hard inquiry", "re-notify
  after dispute", "1681i(d)", "annual report review", "review on
  my birthday", "check report after data breach". Covers applying
  for credit to generate adverse-action letters, demanding CRA re-
  send corrected reports to all recipients (§ 1681i(d) — 6-month /
  2-year employment), monitoring inquiries, re-pulling after data-
  breach notices, and annual reviews. Produces § 1681i(d) re-
  notification demands, annual checklists, and post-breach
  checklists. Composes with consumer-report-ordering, consumer-
  credit-disputes, consumer-report-accuracy, consumer-harm-
  documentation, state *-consumer-debt bundles, and state *-pro-se.

# Consumer Credit Monitoring & Strategy

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** This skill produces drafting aids and checklists. It is not legal advice
> and does not create an attorney-client relationship. Verify every deadline, dollar threshold,
> and statutory citation against current law before relying on or filing anything.

## Purpose

Two forward-looking moves: (1) **generate the proof of harm** that gives a claim teeth, and
(2) once errors are corrected, **propagate the corrections** so prior denials turn into approvals
and every party that saw the bad data sees the good data. Then keep watching.

Statutory text: [`../../references/federal-debt-laws/FCRA.md`](../../references/federal-debt-laws/FCRA.md).

## Generate proof of harm — recent credit applications (optional)

A consumer who hasn't applied for credit recently has no fresh **adverse-action letter** — and the
adverse-action letter is among the cleanest forms of proof of **harm and standing**. If the
consumer chooses to generate this proof:

- If the consumer hasn't applied in a while, one option is to apply within the last 3–6 months so
  a current denial (or worse-terms) letter exists.
- **An application can be informative even with a low score.** The function isn't approval — it's
  to receive the **denial letter** that documents the consequence of the inaccurate report. Route
  any denial to `consumer-report-ordering` (free post-adverse-action report) and
  `consumer-harm-documentation` (damages record).
- Whether to apply for credit at all is a personal-finance decision for the consumer; this skill
  describes only what happens if the consumer chooses to.

## Propagate corrections — re-notify everyone who pulled the report

After a successful dispute/correction, don't stop at the consumer's own copy:

- **Demand the CRA send the corrected report to everyone who received it.** Under 15 U.S.C.
  § 1681i(d), on the consumer's request the CRA must furnish notification of a correction/deletion
  to persons who received the report — **within the prior 6 months** for most purposes (**2 years**
  for employment purposes). The source guidance frames this as "everyone who pulled it in the past
  year"; apply the **statutory 6-month / 2-year windows** when drafting.
- **Monitor soft and hard inquiries** to identify exactly who pulled the file, so each relevant
  party gets the corrected data.
- **Convert denials into approvals.** A corrected report sent back to a creditor/insurer/landlord
  who previously denied the consumer can reopen the decision on better terms.

## Ongoing monitoring cadence

- **Fixed-date annual review.** Pick a memorable date (e.g., the consumer's **birthday**) and
  review **all** reports each year — Big-3 **and** specialty (insurance, utility, medical,
  prescription). Accurate reports need no action; errors trigger a dispute to prevent overpaying or
  future denials.
- **After any data-breach notice,** pull reports **immediately** to catch fraud early and minimize
  damage — and preserve the breach notice (it is itself a free-report trigger and potential claim).
- **Context:** data-breach **class actions** and private FCRA suits are rising as consumers grow
  more vigilant; clear, contemporaneous harm documentation is what maximizes recovery.

## Artifacts this skill drafts

- **§ 1681i(d) re-notification demand** — requests the CRA furnish the corrected/deleted-information
  notice to all recipients within the 6-month (2-year employment) window.
- **Annual-review calendar / checklist** — the fixed-date list of every Big-3 and specialty report
  to pull, with an errors-found → dispute routing column.
- **Post-breach action checklist** — immediate steps after a data-breach notice (pull reports,
  preserve the notice, consider fraud alert/freeze, diary follow-up).

Each artifact ends with the `NOT LEGAL ADVICE` disclaimer.

## Related federal authority

- **ECOA § 1691(d) + Reg B § 1002.9** —
  [`../../references/federal-debt-laws/ECOA.md`](../../references/federal-debt-laws/ECOA.md) /
  [`../../references/federal-debt-laws/Reg-B.md`](../../references/federal-debt-laws/Reg-B.md).
  Applying for credit to generate an **adverse-action (denial) letter** invokes the ECOA / Reg B
  notice regime as well as FCRA § 1681m — both govern the letter you are trying to generate.
- **Reg V §§ 1022.70–1022.75 (12 CFR Part 1022)** —
  [`../../references/federal-debt-laws/Reg-V.md`](../../references/federal-debt-laws/Reg-V.md).
  The **risk-based-pricing notice** is triggered when a report leads to worse terms — relevant when
  a corrected report should convert prior worse-terms offers into better ones.

## Composition

- Order the reports (incl. the post-adverse-action free report) → **`consumer-report-ordering`**.
- File the dispute that produces the correction → **`consumer-credit-disputes`**.
- Confirm the corrected data + dispute marks → **`consumer-report-accuracy`**.
- Turn denials and breach notices into a damages record → **`consumer-harm-documentation`**.
- Underlying debt defense → the state **`*-consumer-debt`** bundle; pro-se mechanics → the state
  **`*-pro-se`** skill.
