# Quality Check — Format + Content (California)

Run a two-pass quality check on a California court document
before filing.

## Arguments

If the user names a file path, use it. Otherwise, glob the
workspace for recent `.docx` or `.pdf` files and ask which one
to check.

## Pass 1 — Format check (CRC 2.100–2.119)

1. **Run the checker:**

   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/format-check.py" "<path>"
   ```

2. **Parse output** and summarize:
   - PASS: item complies
   - WARN: item may deviate; user should verify manually
   - FAIL: item does not comply; must be fixed

3. **What is checked** (Cal. Rules of Court, rules 2.100–2.119):

   - **Paper size**: Letter (8.5" × 11") — rule 2.100
   - **Top margin, page 1**: at least 1", typically 1.5"–2" for
     caption space; rule 2.108(b)
   - **All other margins**: at least 1" — rule 2.108(a)
   - **Font**: Times New Roman or Courier 12pt; or proportional
     font 12pt — rule 2.105
   - **Line spacing**: 1.5 or double-spaced (rule 2.108(c));
     quotations > 50 words may be single-spaced and indented
   - **Line numbers**: required for all pleadings, motions, and
     other documents except Judicial Council forms (rule 2.109);
     line numbers in left margin; 28-line convention
   - **Footer**: page number centered or right-aligned
   - **Two-hole punch**: top of the document (rule 2.119; required
     for paper filing; commonly included even for e-filing)
   - **Page limit for memoranda**: 15 pages (rule 3.1113(d)) —
     20 pages with prior court permission
   - **Exhibits**: labeled with tabs or numbers; cover sheet for
     each; rule 3.1110(f)(4) bookmarks if 25+ pages (e-filed)
   - **No color text** except for exhibits

4. **For each failure**, explain:
   - What CRC requires
   - Where the deviation is
   - How to fix it

## Composition

This skill ALWAYS composes with:

- **`ca-statewide-format`** — CRC 2.100–2.119 requirements
- **The relevant court skill** — for local-rule particulars
  (LASC tentative-ruling procedures; SFSC Department 302 rules;
  county-specific requirements)

It typically follows the draft-* skills and precedes
`ca-fact-check`.

## Cross-references

- `scripts/format-check.py` — the Pass 1 checker
- `ca-statewide-format` — CRC 2.100–2.119 baseline
- `ca-pro-se` — pro per conventions
- `ca-fact-check` — substantive verification pass
- `ca-law-references/references/citation-format.md` — California
  Style Manual rules

**NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Generated content is a drafting aid;
verify against current rules and case law before filing.
