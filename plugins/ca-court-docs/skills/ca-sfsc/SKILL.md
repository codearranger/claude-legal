# San Francisco Superior Court (SFSC)

## Caption — SFSC variant

The court name line for SFSC cases:

```
              IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA
                 COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO
```

Note: San Francisco is both the city and the county — the caption
reads "COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO" even though the filing entity
is formally the City and County of San Francisco.

## Mandatory eFiling — File & ServeXpress

SFSC mandates electronic filing for represented parties in civil
cases through **File & ServeXpress** (FServeXpress).

- Portal: **https://www.fileandservexpress.com/**
- SFSC-specific help: **https://www.sfcourts.org/civil-division/efiling/**
- Accepted format: PDF only
- File-size limit: varies by document type; typically 10-25 MB
  per document
- Account required: attorneys must register a firm account;
  pro se filers may use a self-represented-filer account

Pro se (self-represented) filers may still paper-file at the
clerk's counter (Room 103, Civic Center Courthouse) during
business hours: Monday-Friday, 8:30 a.m.-4:00 p.m. (verify
current hours at **https://www.sfcourts.org**).

## Department 302 — Law and Motion

Department 302 is the SFSC **law and motion department** for
general unlimited civil cases. It handles:

- Demurrers (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10 et seq.)
- Motions to strike (Code Civ. Proc., § 435 et seq.)
- Discovery motions (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.010 et seq.)
- Motions for summary judgment/adjudication (Code Civ. Proc.,
  § 437c)
- All other law and motion matters in unlimitied civil cases
  not assigned to a specific complex or writs department

**Department 302 location**: Civic Center Courthouse, Room 302
(third floor)

**Hearing schedule**: Dept. 302 law-and-motion calendar is
typically held at **9:00 a.m. on court days** (Monday-Friday,
excluding court holidays). Some motions may be calendared at
other times; confirm on the reservation system.

**Department 302 clerk contact**:
- Phone: (415) 551-4012 (confirm current number at sfcourts.org)
- For ex parte matters: call Dept. 302 directly

**Note on department assignment**: Not all civil motions go to
Dept. 302. Cases assigned to the **Complex Civil Program**
(Dept. 302 handles the general civil law-and-motion but complex
cases have dedicated departments, currently Dept. 302 and Dept.
610). Cases in the direct-calendar system (rare) go to the
assigned judge's department. Confirm the correct department on
the case portal before reserving a hearing.

## Reservation system — SFSC Civil Reservation

To reserve a law-and-motion date in Dept. 302:

**Step 1 — Access the SFSC Civil Reservation System**

Go to: **https://www.sfcourts.org/civil-division/reservations/**

Log in with a court account or proceed as a guest. Select
"Department 302 — Law and Motion" from the department menu.

**Step 2 — Select motion type and date**

Choose the motion type from the dropdown (Demurrer, Motion to
Compel, MSJ, etc.). Select an available date. The system will
display available 9:00 a.m. calendar slots.

**Step 3 — Record the reservation number**

The system issues a **Reservation ID** (also called a "reservation
number"). Include this on the face of the Notice of Motion:

```
Date:  [Reserved date]
Time:  9:00 a.m.
Dept.: 302
Judge: Honorable [Assigned Judge]
Reservation ID: [Number]
```

**Step 4 — File the motion with the reserved date**

File through File & ServeXpress. Select Department 302 in the
filing portal. Ensure the reserved date in the motion matches
the reservation system.

**Timing rules**: California law requires the moving party to
give at least **16 court days' notice** before most civil motions
under Code Civ. Proc., § 1005(b). Count court days (excluding
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays). Add 5 calendar days if service
is by mail (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005(b)); 2 court days if by
overnight courier; 0 if by hand or electronic service.

## Tentative-ruling regime (CRC 3.1308; SFSC Local Rule 8.3)

SFSC Dept. 302 uses a tentative-ruling system under Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1308(a)(1) and SFSC Local Rule 8.3:

1. **Tentative ruling posted**: by **4:00 p.m. the court day
   before** the hearing date.

2. **Where to find tentatives**:
   **https://www.sfcourts.org/civil-division/tentative-rulings/**
   Search by case number or department. Alternatively, call
   Dept. 302 at (415) 551-4012 the afternoon before the hearing.

3. **Contest the tentative**:
   - Any party wishing to argue must notify **all other parties**
     AND **Dept. 302** by **4:00 p.m.** on the court day before
     the hearing.
   - Notify the department by phone: (415) 551-4012.
   - If no party timely contests, the tentative **automatically
     becomes the order** without a hearing.

4. **If contested**: hearing proceeds at the scheduled time.
   The court may adopt, modify, or reject the tentative at its
   discretion.

5. **Uncontested tentative practice**: If you are satisfied with
   the tentative and the opposing party has not contested by
   4:00 p.m., you need not appear. The tentative is entered as
   the order.

**Practical checklist the afternoon before a SFSC hearing**:

- [ ] Check tentative on sfcourts.org by 4:00 p.m.
- [ ] If unfavorable or unclear: call Dept. 302 clerk by 4:00 p.m.
      to contest; immediately call/email opposing counsel/party
- [ ] If favorable and no contest: no appearance required;
      confirm by calling Dept. 302 at 8:30 a.m. the morning of
      the hearing

## SFSC ADR program

San Francisco Superior Court has one of the most active
**Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)** programs in California.
SFSC Local Rules, Division IV govern ADR.

**ADR forms**:
- **Early Neutral Evaluation (ENE)**: A neutral evaluator gives
  a non-binding assessment; particularly effective in contract
  and commercial cases
- **Mediation**: Private mediator selected by the parties from
  the SFSC panel or by agreement; court will order mediation
  at the CMC
- **Arbitration** (non-binding judicial arbitration): For cases
  at or below $50,000 (Code Civ. Proc., § 1141.11; SFSC Local
  Rule 4.1)

**ADR timeline**:
- At the CMC, the court typically orders ADR to be completed
  within a specified period before the trial date
- Parties must complete ADR before the Final Status Conference
  (FSC) or risk sanctions
- ADR coordinator: SFSC ADR Office, (415) 551-3876

**Mediator panel**: https://www.sfcourts.org/adr/

## Case management conferences (CMC) at SFSC

SFSC schedules a CMC approximately 180 days after filing of the
complaint (SFSC Local Rules).

**CMC statement (CM-110)**:
- File and serve form CM-110 no later than **15 calendar days**
  before the CMC (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.725(c))
- The CM-110 asks about ADR, trial estimate, discovery, related
  cases, and case complexity
- SFSC requires that the parties confer before the CMC about ADR
  selection (SFSC Local Rule)

**At the CMC**: the judge sets trial date, discovery cutoff,
motion cutoff, FSC date, and ADR deadline. SFSC CMCs are
typically brief (5-10 minutes) unless the case involves complex
scheduling issues.

## SFSC Local Rules — key sections

SFSC Local Rules are posted at:
**https://www.sfcourts.org/civil-division/local-rules/**

| Rule | Subject |
|------|---------|
| 2.1 | Case management — filing requirements |
| 2.4 | Related cases |
| 3.1–3.6 | CMC, case schedule |
| 4.1–4.12 | ADR program |
| 5.1 | Discovery conferences |
| 5.3 | Discovery disputes — meet-and-confer requirements |
| 7.1 | Law and motion — notice requirements |
| 8.1–8.4 | Dept. 302 law-and-motion calendar and tentative rulings |
| 9.1 | Summary judgment motions |
| 10.1 | Complex Civil Program |
| 11.1 | Unlawful detainer — expedited schedule |

Key civil discovery rule: Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040 requires
a written meet-and-confer declaration for all discovery motions.
SFSC Local Rule 5.3 elaborates — parties must meet and confer
by telephone or in person (email alone is not sufficient in SFSC
practice unless the parties have agreed in writing to use email
for M&C).

## Separate statement (discovery motions)

Same as LASC: Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345 requires a
Separate Statement for motions to compel further discovery
responses. File as a separate document.

## Filing fees

Same Government Code schedule as all California superior courts
(Gov. Code, §§ 70600-70679). SFSC-specific note: SFSC adds a
$20 "Complex Litigation" surcharge for cases initially designated
complex. Check current fees at **https://www.sfcourts.org/fees/**.

Fee waiver: Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.50; Judicial Council form
FW-001.
