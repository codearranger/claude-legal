# California Case Deadlines

This skill computes deadlines in California civil cases — when
to answer, file or respond to motions, serve discovery, claim
exemptions, and the statutes of limitations that bound new
actions.

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Verify every deadline against the current
> rule and statute. The legislature can amend the Code of Civil
> Procedure without notice.

## How time is computed in California

### Code Civ. Proc., § 12 — the fundamental rule

- **Exclude the first day** (day of the act, event, or default
  triggering the period).
- **Include the last day** of the period.
- **If the last day is a holiday or weekend**: the period extends
  to the **next court day** (Code Civ. Proc., § 12a).

### Code Civ. Proc., § 12a — holiday/weekend extension

If the last day for filing or service falls on a Saturday, Sunday,
or a judicial holiday, the period extends to the next day that is
not a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday.

### Court days vs. calendar days

Many California deadlines are measured in **court days** (also
called "judicial days"). A court day is any day that the court is
open for business — Monday through Friday excluding judicial
holidays. Other deadlines are measured in **calendar days**
(including weekends and holidays, with extension only if the last
day falls on a non-court day).

Confirm whether a specific deadline uses court days or calendar
days by reading the governing statute or rule.

### Code Civ. Proc., § 12c — court day defined

A "court day" is a day that the court is open for business,
i.e., Monday through Friday excluding judicial holidays listed
in Govt. Code § 6700.

## California judicial holidays (Govt. Code § 6700)

| Holiday | Date |
|---|---|
| New Year's Day | January 1 |
| Martin Luther King, Jr. Day | 3rd Monday of January |
| Presidents' Day | 3rd Monday of February |
| Cesar Chavez Day | March 31 |
| Memorial Day | Last Monday of May |
| Juneteenth | June 19 |
| Independence Day | July 4 |
| Labor Day | 1st Monday of September |
| Native American Day | 4th Friday of September |
| Veterans Day | November 11 |
| Thanksgiving Day | 4th Thursday of November |
| **Day after Thanksgiving** | **4th Friday of November** (Govt. Code § 6700(a)(14)) |
| Christmas Day | December 25 |

**Observed-day rule**: when a holiday falls on a Saturday, courts
observe it on the preceding Friday; when it falls on a Sunday,
courts observe it on the following Monday. Verify per-county
closures — some courts observe additional closures.

**Note — Cesar Chavez Day (March 31)**: while it is a state
employee holiday under Govt. Code § 6700, many superior courts do
not close on Cesar Chavez Day. Verify whether the specific court
will be open before relying on this date as a holiday.

**Note — Lincoln's Birthday (Feb. 12)**: historically observed;
largely phased out. Do not assume courts close on Feb. 12.

## Service additions

### Code Civ. Proc., § 1013 — mail service

When service is by mail, **additional time** is added to any
period requiring response or act:

| Distance | Additional days |
|---|---|
| Within California | 5 calendar days |
| Outside California, within U.S. | 10 calendar days |
| Outside U.S. | 20 calendar days |

The 5-day addition is for the period within which the served
party must perform an act. It applies only when the triggering
act was service by mail; it does NOT apply when the triggering
act was filing or a court order.

### Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6 — electronic service

When service is by electronic means (e-service through an e-
filing system or by email/fax):

- Add **2 court days** to any response period (Code Civ. Proc.,
  § 1010.6(a)(3)(B)).
- Note: mandatory e-filing systems in LASC and many other
  counties deliver e-service at the time of filing; the 2-court-
  day addition still applies to the opposing party's response
  period.

## Deterministic computation

Use the bundled `scripts/case-calendar.py` for date arithmetic:

```bash
# Compute the answer deadline — 30 calendar days from service
# on 2025-04-15
python3 plugins/ca-court-docs/scripts/case-calendar.py \
  --from 2025-04-15 --rule answer-due

# Compute a custom deadline — 16 court days from a given date
python3 plugins/ca-court-docs/scripts/case-calendar.py \
  --from 2025-04-15 --days 16 --mode court

# List all known rules
python3 plugins/ca-court-docs/scripts/case-calendar.py --rules
```

The script encodes Code Civ. Proc., §§ 12, 12a, 1013, 1010.6
and Govt. Code § 6700 holidays.

## Deadlines by procedural posture

### Initial response (defendant)

| Trigger | Deadline | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Personal service (in California) | 30 calendar days from date of service | Code Civ. Proc., § 412.20(a)(3) |
| Service by mail within California (with acknowledgment) | 30 days from signing of acknowledgment | § 415.30(c) |
| Service by publication | 30 days from date of completion of publication | § 415.50 |
| Substituted service (deliver + mail) | 30 days from the date service was deemed complete (10 days after mailing date) | § 415.20(b); § 415.20(c) |
| Defendant served outside California | 40 calendar days | § 412.20(a)(4) |
| Demurrer overruled | 10 days after service of the ruling | § 430.30(c) |

### Motion practice — timing

| Event | Timing | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Motion notice minimum | **16 court days** before hearing | Code Civ. Proc., § 1005(b) |
| Opposition deadline | **9 court days** before hearing | § 1005(b) |

| Meet-and-confer before motion to strike | At least 5 days before MTS deadline | § 435.5(a)(3) |

**Practical note on motion notice**: if the motion is served by

extended by 5 calendar days under § 1013, making the minimum
notice effectively 16 court days + 5 calendar days.

| MSJ/MSA filing cutoff | Must be heard at least **30 days** before trial (unless court allows later) | § 437c(a)(3) |

**Mail/e-service additions apply**: if the MSJ is served by mail,

## Computing examples

### Example 1: Answer to complaint

Defendant personally served on **Wednesday, April 15, 2025**.

Code Civ. Proc., § 412.20(a)(3) — 30 calendar days.

Exclude April 15 (day of service). Start counting April 16.
30 days → **May 15, 2025** (Thursday). May 15 is a court day.

**Answer due May 15, 2025.**

### Example 2: Opposition to motion

Motion served by **mail** on **Friday, April 25, 2025**.
The hearing is set for **Monday, May 19, 2025**.

§ 1005(b) — opposition due 9 court days before hearing.

9 court days before May 19 = count back: May 18 (Sun — skip),
May 17 (Sat — skip), May 16 (1), May 15 (2), May 14 (3),
May 13 (4), May 12 (5), May 9 (6), May 8 (7), May 7 (8),
May 6 (9) = **May 6, 2025**.

Service was by mail (+5 calendar days). Does the mail extension
apply to the opposition deadline? No — the 5-day mail addition
applies to the time to respond to a served document, not to
the opposition deadline which is keyed to the hearing date. The
opposition remains due May 6.

**Opposition due May 6, 2025.**

### Example 3: Summary judgment timeline

Trial date: **Monday, September 8, 2025**.

MSJ notice must be at least 75 days before the hearing. The
last possible hearing date that is at least 30 days before trial
(September 8): on or before August 9, 2025.

Work backward from August 9: 75 days earlier = **May 26, 2025**
(Memorial Day — court holiday). Extend to next court day:
**May 27, 2025**.

MSJ must be **filed and served no later than May 27, 2025** for a
hearing on August 9.

Opposition due 14 days before August 9 = **July 26, 2025.**
Reply due 5 days before August 9 = **August 4, 2025.**

### Example 4: Notice of appeal (unlimited civil)

Judgment entered on the docket; notice of entry of judgment
served on **Friday, April 18, 2025**.

CRC 8.104(a)(1) — 60 days from service of notice of entry.

60 days from April 18 = June 17, 2025 (Tuesday).

**Notice of appeal due June 17, 2025.**

## Common deadline-computation mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Including the day of service | Off-by-one; early deadline |
| Forgetting the 5-day mail addition for § 1013 | Under-served opposition period |
| Confusing court days and calendar days | Wrong deadline (often shorter than actual) |
| Forgetting to extend for the holiday or weekend on the last day | Missed deadline |
| Confusing the 16-court-day motion notice rule with calendar days | Improperly noticed motion |
| Missing Cesar Chavez Day (March 31) — checking if court is open | Varies by court; verify |
| Missing the Day after Thanksgiving (some practitioners skip it) | Off by one day |
| Using 30-day summary judgment notice instead of 75-day California notice | Invalid MSJ; court may take it off calendar |

## When in doubt, file early

Late filings in California civil cases can be fatal — motions to
vacate, notices of appeal, and exemption claims all have strict
deadlines. Build a 5–7 day buffer whenever possible.
