# New York Quality Check

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Pre-filing QC catches the errors that
> would otherwise cause a clerk's-office rejection or a Part-
> Rule denial.

## Two-pass QC

### Pass 1 — Format compliance

Run `scripts/format-check.py` against the PDF for mechanical
checks:

- **Paper size**: 8½ × 11
- **Margins**: 1 inch on all sides
- **Font**: Times New Roman 12-pt or equivalent serif 12-pt
- **Spacing**: Double-spaced; quotations 50+ words may be
  single-spaced and indented
- **Color**: Black text on white
- **Pagination**: Bottom center or bottom right
- **PDF format**: Text-searchable preferred; bookmarks for
  multi-document filings

Manual checks (the script doesn't catch these):

- **Caption box**: court name, county, parties, separator
  ("-against-"), index number, Justice, Part — all present
  and correctly formatted
- **Document title**: descriptive ("Affirmation of [NAME] in
  Support of Motion") and matches the NYSCEF document type
- **Signature block**: pro se "Self-Represented [Plaintiff/
  Defendant]" or attorney with bar number; email address
  prominent
- **Verification** (if a verified pleading): notarized or
  CPLR 2106 affirmed
- **Exhibit cover sheets**: "Exhibit A" with cover sheet
  preceding each exhibit
- **Notice of Motion / OSC**: return date and Part match

### Pass 2 — Content (pro-se drafting framework) compliance

The pro-se drafting framework — the principles documented in `ny-pro-se`:

- **Every factual statement cited** to a paragraph of an
  affirmation/affidavit or a specific exhibit page
- **Every legal assertion cited** to a CPLR section, statute,
  or case in Tanbook format
- **No legal argument in sworn papers** (move to memo)
- **No new facts in memo** (move to affirmation)
- **Plain-language sections** appropriate for the audience
- **Discrete, numbered points** in argument
- **Concession** of weak points; distinguish
- **Restated "ask"** in conclusion

### Pass 2.5 — Substantive law check

- **CPLR citations** match the current code (CPLR amended
  through L 2024)
- **Tanbook citation format** (NY3d, AD3d, Misc 3d; no
  periods)
- **Statute names** correct (CPLR not "C.P.L.R." in body
  text; "N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law" not "GBL" except in
  abbreviation key)
- **Effective dates** considered — e.g., CCFA-affected
  rules (CPLR 213(a), CPLR 3015(e), 22 NYCRR § 202.27-a)
  apply to actions commenced on or after April 7, 2022

## Common NYSCEF rejections

NYSCEF clerks reject filings for:

| Reason | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| Caption missing Index Number | Add to caption |
| Document type wrong | Reselect from NYSCEF dropdown |
| Multiple documents in one PDF | Split per NYSCEF rule |
| Insufficient bookmarks | Add bookmarks at start of each exhibit |
| Image-only PDF (no OCR) | Re-export as text-searchable PDF |
| File size > 100 MB | Split or compress |
| Missing affidavit of service | Re-file with service affidavit |
| Improper redaction (under 22 NYCRR § 202.5(e)) | Re-redact per § 202.5(e) personal-identifying-information rules |

## Part-Rule-specific checks

Some Justices' Part Rules add requirements:

| Common Part Rule requirement | Verify |
|------|--------|
| Pre-motion letter required | Did you file the pre-motion letter? |
| Courtesy copy to chambers | Send paper copy + cover letter? |
| Word-count alternative used | Word-count certification at foot of memo? |
| Joint stipulation re scheduling | Filed before the motion? |
| Oral-argument request | Affirmation requesting argument? |
