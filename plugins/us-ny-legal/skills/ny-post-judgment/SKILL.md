## Motion to vacate a judgment — CPLR 5015(a)

The principal post-judgment relief mechanism. CPLR 5015(a)
allows vacatur on these grounds:

| Ground | Authority | Time limit |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Excusable default | CPLR 5015(a)(1) | 1 year from notice of entry |
| Newly discovered evidence | CPLR 5015(a)(2) | Reasonable time |
| Fraud / misrepresentation | CPLR 5015(a)(3) | Reasonable time |
| Lack of jurisdiction | CPLR 5015(a)(4) | No time limit |
| Reversal / modification of prior order | CPLR 5015(a)(5) | Reasonable time |

The most-litigated ground in consumer-debt cases:

### (a)(1) — Excusable default

Must show **both**:

1. **Reasonable excuse** for the default (e.g., never
   served; service was defective; medical emergency)
2. **Meritorious defense** to the underlying claim

The 1-year window runs from receipt of notice of entry, not
from the judgment date. Pro se defendants in consumer-debt
cases often miss it; the **22 NYCRR § 202.27-a** (CCFA)
heightened-evidence rule for default judgments now creates
additional grounds for vacatur where the original default
application was inadequate.

### (a)(4) — Lack of jurisdiction

If service was defective (no service, wrong address,
defective substitute service under CPLR 308) — **no time
limit** to vacate. A common pro se motion in NY Civil Court
debt-collection cases where the process server filed a
"sewer service" affidavit.

## CPLR Article 52 — Enforcement of money judgments

### Restraining Notice — CPLR 5222

A judgment creditor can serve a Restraining Notice on:

- The judgment debtor — restrains transfer of any property
  except as permitted (exemptions, periodic exempt income)
- A garnishee (bank, employer, tenant) — restrains transfer
  of money/property owed to the debtor

**Duration**: 1 year (CPLR 5222(b)).

**Limit**: A bank served with a restraining notice cannot
restrain more than **twice the amount of the judgment** in
a single account; cannot freeze more than the judgment
amount.

### Income Execution (Wage Garnishment) — CPLR 5231

10% gross wages cap; 25% disposable income cap under federal
law (CCPA, 15 USC § 1673). Process:

1. **Income execution served on judgment debtor first**
   (CPLR 5231(d)) — debtor has 20 days to pay
2. **If unpaid**, served on employer
3. Employer remits per pay period

### Property Execution / Levy — CPLR 5232

Sheriff levies on property; bank accounts, autos, etc.
**Exempt** property cannot be seized (CPLR 5205, 5206).

### Exempt Income Protection Act (EIPA) — CPLR 5222-a

A 2008 reform protecting exempt income from bank-account
restraint. When a Restraining Notice is served on a bank:

1. The bank must give the debtor a **CPLR 5222-a notice +
   exemption claim form** (EJ-FOC-1)
2. The first **$3,090** (adjusted; 2024 figure) of an
   account containing exempt income (Social Security, SSI,
   VA benefits, public assistance, alimony, child support,
   workers' comp, unemployment) is **automatically
   protected**
3. The debtor can claim additional exemption by completing
   the form

Pro se debtors should immediately complete the EJ-FOC-1 if
their account contains exempt income.

### Exemptions — CPLR 5205, 5206

Personal property exemptions (CPLR 5205):

- Necessary household furniture / appliances / clothing
- Bibles, school books, pictures (limited values)
- A wedding ring
- One motor vehicle worth ≤ **$5,275** (2024 adjustment;
  CPLR 5205(a)(8))
- Tools of trade worth ≤ **$3,825**
- Cash exemption: lesser of **$2,750** or amount available
  if no homestead claimed

Homestead exemption (CPLR 5206):

- **NYC, Nassau, Suffolk, Rockland, Westchester, Putnam:
  $165,550** (2024)
- **Albany, Columbia, Dutchess, Orange, Saratoga, Ulster:
  $137,950**
- **Rest of state: $82,775**

### Subpoena to bank / Information subpoena — CPLR 5224

Creditor can serve an information subpoena on a bank to
discover the debtor's accounts. Debtor has **7 days** to
move to quash.

### Turnover proceeding — CPLR 5225 / 5227

Special proceeding to compel a third party (bank, employer)
to turn over specific property. CPLR 5225(b) requires a
**notice of motion** in a special proceeding format
(commenced under CPLR 403).

### Satisfaction of Judgment — CPLR 5020

When the judgment is paid, the creditor **must** file a
satisfaction. Failure to do so within 20 days of debtor's
written demand exposes the creditor to **$100 + costs +
attorney's fees** under CPLR 5020(c).

## NY 20-year SOL on money judgments — CPLR 211(b)

Money judgments in NY are enforceable for **20 years** from
entry (CPLR 211(b)). Compare WA (10 years) / OR (10 years) /
CA (10 years renewable). NY's 20-year window is the longest
in the U.S. — relevant when an old judgment surfaces.

## Information subpoena practice

A common post-judgment device: serve an information subpoena
(plus questionnaire) on the debtor or a garnishee to discover
assets. Debtor must respond within 7 days; failure is
contempt (CPLR 5251).
