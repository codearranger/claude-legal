# First 30 Days — After Service in a New York Civil Case

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Missing the answer deadline can
> cause a default judgment under CPLR 3215. Compute the
> deadline carefully (see `ny-deadlines`).

## Answer deadlines — CPLR 3012

| Mode of service | Deadline |
|-----------------|---------|
| Personal delivery in-state (CPLR 308(1)) | **20 days** from service |
| Substituted "leave and mail" (CPLR 308(2)) | **30 days** from service being complete (service complete 10 days after filing affidavit of service) |
| "Nail and mail" (CPLR 308(4)) | **30 days** from service being complete |
| Personal service out-of-state | **30 days** from delivery |
| Service by publication (CPLR 308(5)) | **30 days** from publication complete |
| Service on Secretary of State (corporation, CPLR 311) | **30 days** from Secretary's mailing |

**Important**: under CPLR 308(2)/(4), service is **complete
10 days after** the affidavit of service is filed. The
answer clock runs from completion, not from the date
delivery was attempted. So substituted service has a built-in
40-day buffer (10 + 30) before the answer is due.

## Pre-answer motion to dismiss — CPLR 3211

Instead of answering, a defendant can file a pre-answer
motion to dismiss. Grounds under **CPLR 3211(a)**:

| Sub | Ground |
|-----|--------|
| (1) | A defense founded upon documentary evidence |
| (2) | Court has no subject-matter jurisdiction |
| (3) | Party lacks legal capacity to sue |
| (4) | There is another action pending between the same parties |
| (5) | Cause of action may not be maintained because of arbitration / collateral estoppel / discharge / infancy / payment / release / res judicata / statute of limitations / statute of frauds |
| (6) | Court lacks jurisdiction over a counterclaim |
| (7) | Pleading fails to state a cause of action |
| (8) | Court has no personal jurisdiction over the defendant |
| (9) | Court has no jurisdiction in cases involving the State |
| (10) | Court should not proceed in the absence of a person who should be a party |
| (11) | Subject of the action is property which has been distributed by a receiver / fiduciary |

**CPLR 3211(e)** is the consolidation rule: most CPLR 3211
defenses **must be raised in the first responsive paper** or
they are waived (especially (a)(1), (4), (5), (8) personal
jurisdiction). (a)(2) and (a)(7) can be raised at any time.

Filing a CPLR 3211 motion **extends the answer deadline**
until 10 days after service of the order deciding the motion
(CPLR 3211(f)).

## Common defenses by case type

### Consumer-debt complaint (most common pro se case)

- **CPLR 3211(a)(5) — Statute of Limitations**: Post-CCFA
  (2022), credit-card and other consumer-credit debts have a
  **3-year SOL** under CPLR 213(a). For older debt-buyer
  complaints, this is often the strongest defense.
- **CPLR 3211(a)(7) — Failure to state a cause of action**:
  Post-CCFA, the complaint must comply with CPLR 3015(e) —
  identifying the original creditor, chain of title, account
  number, default date, and amount as of charge-off.
  Non-compliance is fatal.
- **CPLR 3211(a)(8) — Lack of personal jurisdiction**: If
  service was defective (e.g., never received the summons),
  raise here.
- **CPLR 3211(a)(3) — Capacity**: Some debt buyers lack
  capacity if not registered/licensed where required (NY
  Gen. Bus. Law § 600).

### Tort complaint (PI, defamation)

- **CPLR 3211(a)(5) — Statute of Limitations**: PI 3 years
  (CPLR 214(5)); defamation 1 year (CPLR 215(3))
- **CPLR 3211(a)(7)**: failure to state a cause of action

### Foreclosure complaint

- **CPLR 3211(a)(3)**: standing (plaintiff must hold note
  and mortgage at commencement — see *Aurora Loan Services
  v. Taylor*, 25 NY3d 355 (2015))
- **CPLR 3408**: triggers mandatory foreclosure-settlement
  conference

## Answer mechanics — CPLR 3018

If answering rather than moving to dismiss, the answer must:

1. **Admit or deny each allegation** (CPLR 3018(a))
2. **Set forth affirmative defenses** (CPLR 3018(b)) — must
   be specifically pleaded; common: SOL, payment, release,
   accord-and-satisfaction, license, illegality, fraud,
   contributory negligence
3. **Plead counterclaims** as the answer (CPLR 3019(a))
4. **Verify** if the complaint was verified (CPLR 3020(a))

## Counterclaims — CPLR 3019

NY does not have a strict compulsory-counterclaim rule. CPLR
3019 says counterclaims **may** be asserted; the consequence
of not asserting is res judicata only as to claims actually
litigated. But waiting can be procedurally costly.

In consumer-debt defense: assert **FDCPA, GBL § 349, GBL §
600 violations** as counterclaims (see `ny-consumer-debt`).

## Extension stipulation

CPLR 2104 allows the parties to stipulate to an extension.
Typical practice: a 20-day or 30-day extension by emailed
stipulation (signed by both sides). File via NYSCEF as
"Stipulation Extending Time to Answer." No court approval
required if filed before the original deadline.

## Triage checklist

For a newly served defendant:

1. **Calendar the answer deadline** (`ny-deadlines`)
2. **Verify service was proper** (CPLR 308 — is the
   affidavit of service correct?)
3. **Run an SOL check** — was the debt charged off more
   than 3 years ago (CPLR 213(a)) for consumer credit?
4. **CCFA compliance check** — does the complaint identify
   the original creditor, chain of title, account number,
   default date (CPLR 3015(e))?
5. **Choose path**: CPLR 3211 motion / verified answer with
   affirmative defenses + counterclaims / extension
   stipulation if more time needed
6. **Draft via** `ny-draft-motion` or write an answer using
   the pro-se drafting framework
