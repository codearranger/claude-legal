name: ny-draft-declaration
description: >
  Scaffold an affirmation (CPLR 2106) or affidavit (CPLR
  2309) for a New York court filing. Triggers include
  'draft an affirmation', 'New York affidavit', 'CPLR 2106
  affirmation', 'affirmation in support', 'affidavit of
  merit', 'affidavit of service', 'affidavit in opposition',
  'NY sworn statement', 'NY declaration of [person]',
  'verify a NY pleading'. Produces an affirmation under the
  amended CPLR 2106 (post-2023 — any person may affirm
  under penalty of perjury without a notary) or a traditional
  CPLR 2309 affidavit, conformed to CPLR 2101 paper-format
  rules. **Note**: NY uses "affirmation/affidavit"
  terminology — the word "declaration" does not appear in
  NY civil practice. This skill is named draft-declaration
  for filename consistency but produces NY-correct
  affirmations/affidavits.

# Draft a New York Affirmation or Affidavit

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Sworn statements are subject to
> perjury sanctions. Verify every factual statement.

## Affirmation v. affidavit — choose correctly

| Document | Authority | Notary? | Who can sign |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Affirmation** | CPLR 2106 (as amended 2023) | **No** | Any person, attorney or layperson |
| Affidavit | CPLR 2309 | **Yes** | Any person |

**2023 amendment (L 2023, ch 559)** democratized affirmation:
before, only attorneys (and certain medical/dental
professionals) could affirm without a notary. Now any person
may use the CPLR 2106 affirmation form, ending the
notary-bottleneck for pro se filers.

When to choose each:

- **Affirmation**: default for nearly all situations in
  Supreme Court / Civil Court motion practice
- **Affidavit**: required in specific contexts — verification
  of pleading under CPLR 3020 (some statutes require notary);
  affidavit of service when not by NY-licensed process
  server; affidavit in support of attachment under CPLR
  6212; affidavit of merit in default judgment under CPLR
  3215(b) — historically required (but the CCFA 2022 changes
  shifted this — see `ny-consumer-debt`)

## Drafting rules — facts only

The affirmation/affidavit is a **sworn statement of facts** —
not legal argument. Per CPLR 3024(b), a court may strike
**scandalous or prejudicial** matter; pure legal argument in
an affirmation is also routinely stricken.

- **One fact per paragraph** — numbered
- **First-person**: "I served the notice" not "the
  defendant served"
- **Personal knowledge**: each fact must be within the
  affiant's personal knowledge unless explicitly "upon
  information and belief"
- **Attach exhibits**: every document referenced should be an
  Exhibit attached to the affirmation
- **Cross-reference exhibits**: "Attached as Exhibit A is a
  true and accurate copy of [...]"
- **Avoid legal conclusions**: "The plaintiff failed to serve
  proper process" → legal conclusion; rewrite as
  "Plaintiff's process server filed an affidavit stating
  service at [ADDRESS]; I did not reside at [ADDRESS] on
  that date" (factual)

## Exhibit attachment conventions

- **Lettered**: Exhibits A, B, C... (NY convention; numbered
  exhibits are uncommon)
- **Tabbed**: for paper filings, tabbed dividers
- **Bookmarked**: for NYSCEF/PDF filings, PDF bookmarks at
  the start of each exhibit
- **Bates-stamped** (recommended): for filings with multiple
  exhibits, Bates-stamp pages

## Common affirmation types

| Type | When |
|------|------|
| Affirmation in Support of Motion | With a Notice of Motion |
| Affirmation in Opposition | Responding to a motion |
| Affirmation in Reply | Replying to opposition |
| Affirmation in Support of OSC | With an Order to Show Cause |
