  This skill should be used to scaffold a Georgia scheduling document —
  a Notice of Hearing or the Rule Nisi presented for the judge's
  signature. Triggers include "notice of hearing Georgia", "rule nisi",
  "draft a rule nisi Georgia", "draft a notice of hearing for my
  motion", "set my motion for hearing Georgia", "Georgia hearing notice
  for a motion to compel". Produces the Notice of Hearing / Rule Nisi
  that identifies the underlying motion, the date, time, and place set
  by the court, and the certificate of service, and explains how the
  Notice of Hearing pairs with the Rule Nisi the judge signs under USCR
  6.3 / 6.4.

# Draft a Georgia Notice of Hearing / Rule Nisi

Use this skill in addition to `ga-statewide-format` when a motion
requires a hearing date to be placed on the court's calendar. In
Georgia, a party requesting oral argument requests it within the
response period (USCR 6.3); the hearing date is then set by the court.
Two paired documents do the work:

| Document | Who prepares / signs | Purpose | Authority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Notice of Hearing** | Filer prepares and serves | Notifies all parties of the date, time, and place of a hearing on a pending motion | USCR 6.3 / 6.4 |
| **Rule Nisi** | Filer drafts; **judge signs** | The court's order setting the matter down and directing the parties to appear and show cause | USCR 6.3 / 6.4 |

The filer commonly prepares the **Rule Nisi** in proposed form and
submits it with the motion; the judge signs it, fixing the date. The
**Notice of Hearing** then transmits that date to the parties with a
certificate of service. (When the matter calls for the judge's signed
ruling rather than a scheduling order, see `ga-draft-order`.)
