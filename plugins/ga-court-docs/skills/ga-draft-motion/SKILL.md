  This skill should be used to scaffold a Georgia civil motion with
  its supporting brief. Triggers include "draft a Georgia motion",
  "write a motion to dismiss Georgia", "draft a Georgia motion to

  motion to set aside default Georgia", "draft a motion under O.C.G.A.
  § 9-11-56". Produces a motion plus supporting brief in the Georgia
  format, applying the pro-se drafting framework (clear relief, cite
  the rule or statute, state supporting facts, conclude with the
  signature block and required certificate of service). Composes with
  `ga-statewide-format` for the format baseline, `ga-draft-declaration`
  for sworn facts, `ga-draft-order` for the proposed order, and the
  relevant venue and subject-matter skills.

Use this skill to produce a motion plus supporting brief in Georgia
format. Georgia motion practice is governed by the Civil Practice Act
(O.C.G.A. Title 9, Ch. 11), the rule under which the motion is filed
(e.g., O.C.G.A. § 9-11-12(b)(6), § 9-11-56, § 9-11-37(a),
§ 9-11-55(b)), and the Uniform Superior Court Rules (USCR 6 governs
motion practice; the parallel Uniform State Court Rules apply in State
Court).

## Motion timing under USCR 6

| Event | Timing |
|---|---|
| Response to a motion | 30 days after service (USCR 6.2) |
| Request for oral hearing | Within the response period; must be requested or it may be waived (USCR 6.3) |
| Summary-judgment motion | Served at least 30 days before the hearing (O.C.G.A. § 9-11-56(c)) |

When a hearing is sought, prepare a **Rule Nisi / Notice of Hearing**
under USCR 6.3 (see `ga-draft-note`) for the judge to set the date.

                                        [Name]
                                        [Address]

                                         Attorney for ____  —

                   CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE
[Date, method, recipients — per O.C.G.A. § 9-11-5 and
ga-statewide-format]
```

## Signature and certificate requirements

- **Signature** — every motion must be signed (O.C.G.A. § 9-11-11). A
  pro se filer signs and adds name, address, phone, and email with the
  designation **Pro Se**. An attorney adds the **Georgia Bar No.**
- **Certificate of service** — subsequent papers are served and the
  service certified under O.C.G.A. § 9-11-5; place the certificate of
  service at the foot of the motion.
- **Rule Nisi / Notice of Hearing** — when a hearing is sought, attach
  or file the scheduling document under USCR 6.3 (see `ga-draft-note`).
- **Format defaults** — line numbering down the left margin and a
  footer "Page X of Y" are marketplace format defaults applied through
  `ga-statewide-format`.

## Common motion types

| Motion | Authority | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Motion to Dismiss | O.C.G.A. § 9-11-12(b)(6) | Failure to state a claim |
| Motion for Summary Judgment | O.C.G.A. § 9-11-56 | Served at least 30 days before hearing; *Lau's Corp. v. Haskins*, 261 Ga. 491 (1991) (movant may point to absence of evidence) |
| Motion to Compel | O.C.G.A. § 9-11-37(a) | Attach the deficient responses |
| Motion to Set Aside Default | O.C.G.A. § 9-11-55(b) | Open as of right within 15 days plus costs under § 9-11-55(a); otherwise providential/excusable/proper case + four conditions |
| Motion for Protective Order | O.C.G.A. § 9-11-26(c) | Discovery-shielding |
| Motion to Amend | O.C.G.A. § 9-11-15 | As of right before entry of the pretrial order |

## Argument structure — the pro-se drafting framework

1. **State the relief clearly** in the opening sentence.
2. **Cite the rule or statute** that grants the court power to award it.
3. **State the facts** that satisfy each element of the standard.
4. **Apply controlling Georgia case law** to those facts.
5. **Conclude** with the specific order sought.

A motion that hides the relief, buries the statute citation, or omits
a clear element-by-element factual showing is the kind of filing the
court will struggle to engage with.
