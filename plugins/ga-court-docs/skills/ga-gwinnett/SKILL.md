# Gwinnett County Trial Courts (Gwinnett Judicial Circuit)

Use this skill in addition to `ga-statewide-format` whenever the case
is in a Gwinnett County trial court. The **Gwinnett Judicial Circuit**
is a single-county circuit (Gwinnett County only), seated at **75
Langley Drive, Lawrenceville, Georgia** (*verify the current
address*). Pick the right court first — Georgia splits trial
jurisdiction by **subject matter**, not by dollar amount.

## Which Gwinnett court

- **Superior Court of Gwinnett County** — general-jurisdiction trial
  court for the Gwinnett Judicial Circuit; reported at roughly 11
  judges sitting in Divisions 1 through 11 (*verify judge count
  against the current bench*). **Exclusive** over divorce, equity,
  title to land, and felonies (O.C.G.A. §§ 15-6-1, 15-6-8). Court
  **terms** convene the first Monday in March, June, and December and
  the second Monday in September (O.C.G.A. § 15-6-3).
- **State Court of Gwinnett County** — reported at roughly 7 judges
  (*verify against the current bench*). Civil jurisdiction of **any
  amount** with no dollar ceiling (O.C.G.A. § 15-7-4), except the
  superior-exclusive subjects. Most debt-collection and tort suits are
  filed here.
- **Magistrate Court of Gwinnett County** — one of Georgia's busiest
  magistrate courts, reported at roughly 21 judges (*verify against
  the current bench*). Civil cap of **$15,000** (O.C.G.A. § 15-10-2),
  with **no cap on dispossessory** money judgments. Note the
  **enhanced post-judgment discovery** posture under O.C.G.A. § 9-11-69
  where a dispossessory or distress judgment exceeds **$5,000**.
- **Business docket** — Gwinnett **opted into the Metro Atlanta
  Business Case Division (MABCD)**, the first county outside Fulton to
  do so and the **only county to enroll both its State and Superior
  courts** in the division. MABCD has no fixed dollar threshold and
  takes cases by transfer; it is distinct from the statewide Georgia
  State-wide Business Court (O.C.G.A. § 15-5A).

## Caption

Name the specific court and "STATE OF GEORGIA" in the caption, with
the county in the court line (O.C.G.A. § 9-11-10(a)).

```
SUPERIOR COURT OF GWINNETT COUNTY
STATE OF GEORGIA

[PLAINTIFF NAME],
                              Plaintiff,
v.                                          Civil Action File No. __________

[DEFENDANT NAME],
                              Defendant.

                         [TITLE OF PLEADING]
```

For the State Court, substitute the court line with **"STATE COURT OF
GWINNETT COUNTY / STATE OF GEORGIA"**. The Georgia case-number
designation is **"Civil Action File No. ____"**; the number is
assigned by the clerk at filing — do not invent or guess it. Party
designations are Plaintiff/Defendant in civil actions and
Petitioner/Respondent in divorce and family matters.

## E-filing — Odyssey eFileGA (NOT PeachCourt)

Gwinnett civil filings run through **Odyssey eFileGA** (the Tyler
Odyssey portal) — **not PeachCourt**. Flag this clearly: a filer who
defaults to the PeachCourt portal will be at the wrong gateway for
Gwinnett. E-filing is **mandatory** for all State and Superior civil
cases and **optional** in the Magistrate Court. Confirm the current
portal entry point and document codes with the Clerk of Superior Court
before filing.

## Mandatory ADR + Superior Court Transfer Rules

- **Mandatory ADR program** — Gwinnett operates a court-annexed
  alternative-dispute-resolution program; civil cases are routinely
  ordered to ADR. Check the current ADR order and timing for the case.
- **Superior Court Transfer Rules** — Gwinnett publishes transfer
  rules governing movement of cases **between the State and Superior
  Courts** (e.g., when a State Court case implicates a
  superior-exclusive subject). Consult these before assuming the
  filing court can keep a matter.
- **Standing orders by document number** — Gwinnett publishes its
  standing orders by document number; cite the operative document
  number in filings that reference them.

## Domestic standing order + child-support computation

When a domestic case is filed, a **domestic standing order**
auto-attaches and binds both parties on filing/service, and Gwinnett
separately issues a **Child Support Computation Procedures** order
governing the worksheet and supporting documentation. Read the
operative orders in the case and route domestic mechanics through
`ga-family-court`. Judge counts, division assignments, and the
courthouse address change; treat any specific count or address here as
**verify-against-current**.

## Composition

- `ga-statewide-format` — format baseline (O.C.G.A. § 9-11-10 + USCR)
- `ga-state-court` — State Court of Gwinnett County practice
- `ga-magistrate` — Magistrate Court $15,000 / dispossessory mechanics
- `ga-family-court` — divorce, equity, and the domestic standing order
- `ga-consumer-debt` — debt-collection subject-matter bundle
- `ga-first-30-days` — answer, defenses, counterclaims
- `ga-file-packet` — assemble and preflight the filing packet
- `ga-schedule-hearing` — setting hearings and rule nisi
- `ga-deadlines` — time computation and Georgia holidays
