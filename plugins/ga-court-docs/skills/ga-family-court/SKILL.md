# Georgia Family Court — Family Matters in the Superior Court

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Divorce, custody, support, legitimation, and
> family-violence outcomes have lasting consequences for children,
> property, and safety. Strongly consider consulting a licensed
> Georgia family-law attorney even on an agreed or "simple" matter.
> This skill is a drafting/venue aid; verify the filing county's
> current local rules, any Family Division standing order, and the
> controlling statutes before filing. Local rules and judge-specific
> practices change; confirm with the clerk first.

Georgia has **no separate, free-standing family-court trial court**
and **no single statewide Family Division statute.** Domestic-relations
matters are heard in the **Superior Court** — Georgia's
general-jurisdiction trial court. Divorce jurisdiction is **vested in
the Superior Court by O.C.G.A. § 19-5-1.** Several high-volume circuits
run a **Family Division or a family case-management track by local
rule or standing order** — for example, **Fulton County Superior Court**
and **DeKalb** operate dedicated Family Divisions, and **Cobb (Cobb
Judicial Circuit, Marietta)** and **Gwinnett (Gwinnett Judicial
Circuit, Lawrenceville)** run family case-management tracks. Treat the
**existence and procedure of any Family Division as a per-court
(venue-specific) detail** to verify with the local clerk and the
controlling standing order. This skill covers **where to file and
filing mechanics**; substantive law lives in `ga-family-law`.

## Procedure is the Civil Practice Act

Georgia family cases run on the **Georgia Civil Practice Act (O.C.G.A.
Title 9, Ch. 11)** and the **Uniform Superior Court Rules**, in the
Superior Court. Title 19 (Domestic Relations) supplies the substantive
law and certain special procedures (the waiting period, the mandatory
parenting plan, the financial-disclosure requirements). A circuit's
**Family Division standing order** — common in family cases — may add
**mutual restraining provisions** (preserving the status quo, barring
dissipation of assets, restricting relocation of children) and
**mandatory parenting seminars** that take effect on filing. These are
**per-circuit**: confirm whether the filing court has a standing order
and what it requires before filing.

## What this venue handles

| Matter | Heard in the Superior Court? |
|---|---|
| Divorce / separate maintenance / annulment | **Yes** (O.C.G.A. § 19-5-1) |
| Equitable division of property | Yes — with the divorce |
| Alimony | Yes — with the divorce (O.C.G.A. § 19-6-1 et seq.) |
| Custody and visitation | **Yes** (O.C.G.A. § 19-9-3) |
| Child support and modification | **Yes** (O.C.G.A. § 19-6-15) |
| Legitimation | **Yes** (O.C.G.A. § 19-7-22) |
| Paternity | **Yes** (O.C.G.A. § 19-7-40 et seq.) |
| Contempt and modification | **Yes** |
| Adoption | **Yes** |
| Termination of parental rights | **Yes** |
| **Family-violence protective orders (TPOs)** | **Yes** (O.C.G.A. § 19-13-1 et seq.) — distinct procedure (see below) |
| UCCJEA / UIFSA jurisdiction | O.C.G.A. § 19-9-40 et seq. / § 19-11-100 et seq. |

> **Terminology.** Use **Petitioner** and **Respondent** for the
> parties and the **Superior Court** (or its Family Division, where the
> circuit has one) for the forum. Note that **legitimation and paternity
> are distinct** — a paternity action establishing support does not by
> itself confer custody or visitation; legitimation under § 19-7-22 is
> the vehicle for an unwed biological father's parental rights. Confirm
> the right vehicle against `ga-family-law`.

## Required filings unique to family cases

- **Domestic Relations Financial Affidavit (DRFA).** A sworn statement
  of income, expenses, assets, and debts is a **standard required
  filing** in contested divorce, support, and modification matters.
  Confirm the circuit's current form and exchange/filing deadline with
  the local rule. Use `ga-draft-declaration` for the sworn form.
- **Child Support Worksheet.** Where children are involved, the
  **Georgia Child Support Worksheet** generated through the **Georgia
  Child Support Commission calculator** (the official income-shares
  worksheet) is a standard required filing. The substantive
  income-shares calculation (BCSO table, add-ons, deviations) lives in
  `ga-family-law` (O.C.G.A. § 19-6-15).
- **Parenting Plan — mandatory.** A **Parenting Plan is mandatory under
  O.C.G.A. § 19-9-1** in any case involving custody/visitation of a
  minor child (schedule, holidays, decision-making, transportation).
  The court will not enter a final custody order without one. The
  required contents are detailed in `ga-family-law`.

## Family-violence protective orders are a distinct track

A **family-violence Temporary Protective Order (TPO)** under **O.C.G.A.
§ 19-13-1 et seq.** runs on its **own statutory procedure** — even when
the same parties have a pending divorce or custody case. Coordinate the
two cases but do not fold the TPO petition into the divorce/custody
filing. Key framework features to verify against `ga-family-law`:

- **Free to file** — no filing fee for a family-violence TPO petition;
  use the standardized **GSCCCA** TPO forms.
- **Venue** is the **respondent's county** (O.C.G.A. § 19-13-2).
- The court may issue an **ex parte TPO** good for **up to 30 days**,
  with a **mandatory hearing within ~30 days** (O.C.G.A. § 19-13-3);
  after a hearing the court may enter a protective order up to one year
  (extendable).

TPO matters are time-sensitive and often involve safety concerns;
encourage prompt consultation with counsel or a local family-violence
advocate.

> Adoption and termination of parental rights are likewise specialized
> proceedings with heightened procedure; confirm the governing
> statutory scheme before treating them as an ordinary family matter.

## Venue and jurisdiction

- File in the **Superior Court of the county of proper venue.** For
  divorce, venue is **generally the respondent's county** (**O.C.G.A.
  § 19-5-2**); confirm the Georgia **residency** prerequisite (a bona
  fide resident period before filing) against `ga-family-law` and
  § 19-5-2.
- For a family-violence TPO, venue is the **respondent's county**
  (§ 19-13-2).
- If there are minor children, confirm Georgia is the child's **home
  state** under the **UCCJEA (O.C.G.A. § 19-9-40 et seq.)** and plead
  the jurisdictional allegations (`ga-family-law`).
- Confirm the circuit's family-docket assignment, **whether a Family
  Division or family case-management track applies**, and any
  **automatic standing order** with the venue skill (`ga-fulton`,
  `ga-cobb`, `ga-gwinnett`, `ga-county-courts`).

## The caption and parties

Designate the parties **Petitioner** and **Respondent** and the forum
the **Superior Court** of the county (its **Family Division** where the
circuit runs one). Build the caption under `ga-statewide-format` (the
O.C.G.A. § 9-11-10 caption, the Uniform Superior Court Rules form, and
the signature block).

## Filing mechanics

1. **Confirm jurisdiction and venue** — Superior Court of the proper
   county; divorce residency and venue (**§ 19-5-2**); TPO venue
   (**§ 19-13-2**); UCCJEA home-state allegations for children
   (`ga-family-law`).
2. **Check the circuit's Family Division / standing order** — determine
   whether the filing court has a Family Division or family
   case-management track and whether an **automatic standing order**
   (mutual restraining provisions, mandatory parenting seminar) takes
   effect on filing; comply with and serve it as the local rule
   requires.
3. **Prepare the initiating documents** — the **Petition for Divorce**
   (or Petition for Legitimation / Petition to Establish Paternity /
   Petition for Modification / Petition for Contempt), pleading the
   statutory ground and the custody/support/property requests. Use
   `ga-statewide-format` for the caption and form and `ga-draft-motion`
   / `ga-draft-declaration` / `ga-draft-order` for the documents.
4. **Assemble the required family filings** — the **Domestic Relations
   Financial Affidavit**, the **Child Support Worksheet** (Georgia
   Child Support Commission calculator) where children are involved,
   and the **mandatory Parenting Plan (§ 19-9-1)** for any custody
   matter.
5. **File and pay (or waive) the fee** — with the **Clerk of Superior
   Court** of the county. A self-represented filer who cannot afford
   costs may file a **poverty affidavit / pauper's affidavit under
   O.C.G.A. § 9-15-2** to proceed without prepayment of costs (a
   family-violence TPO petition is free to file). Confirm the county's
   filing fee and the e-filing path: Georgia counties file electronically
   through **PeachCourt** or **Odyssey eFileGA**, depending on the
   county (`ga-file-packet`, and the venue skill).
6. **Serve** the petition under the applicable service rule (personal
   service of the summons and petition); track the **answer/response**
   window under the Civil Practice Act (`ga-first-30-days`). For a TPO,
   the ex parte order and hearing notice are served on the respondent.
7. **Track the waiting period and disclosures** — confirm the **divorce
   waiting period** (no final no-fault divorce until the statutory
   period runs after service) against `ga-family-law` and § 19-5-3, and
   complete any mandatory parenting seminar (`ga-deadlines`,
   `ga-schedule-hearing`).

## Self-represented (pro se) family intake

- Georgia courts publish self-help family-law **forms and packets**
  (uncontested divorce with/without minor children, legitimation,
  modification) through the Judicial Council / Administrative Office of
  the Courts and the county clerks; **GSCCCA** publishes the standardized
  **family-violence TPO** forms. Confirm the current packet and that the
  county accepts it.
- File with the **Clerk of Superior Court** of the county of proper
  venue (generally the respondent's county, § 19-5-2). Designate the
  filer clearly as self-represented in the signature block (no State Bar
  of Georgia number) — see `ga-pro-se`.
- Clerks and self-help-center staff explain **procedure**, not legal
  advice. Encourage consultation with a licensed Georgia family-law
  attorney where there are minor children, retirement assets, real
  property, a business, safety concerns, or any disputed issue.

## Composition

- For substantive law (divorce grounds and the waiting period, equitable
  division, alimony, the § 19-9-3 best-interests custody analysis and
  the child's-election rule, the § 19-6-15 income-shares child-support
  calculation, legitimation vs. paternity, the mandatory parenting plan,
  UCCJEA/UIFSA, and the family-violence overlay): `ga-family-law`
- For document format and the Georgia caption: `ga-statewide-format`
- For the specific county / clerk / Family Division assignment and
  e-filing: `ga-fulton`, `ga-cobb`, `ga-gwinnett`, `ga-county-courts`
- For pro se conventions and self-help forms: `ga-pro-se`
- For the response and the first-30-days posture: `ga-first-30-days`
- For deadlines, the divorce waiting period, and time computation:
  `ga-deadlines`
- For drafting the petition / response / motion: `ga-draft-motion`
- For the Domestic Relations Financial Affidavit and other sworn
  declarations: `ga-draft-declaration`
- For the proposed parenting plan / decree / order: `ga-draft-order`,
  `ga-submit-order`
- For assembling and preflighting the filing packet: `ga-file-packet`
- For scheduling and hearings: `ga-schedule-hearing`, `ga-hearings`
- For citation verification: `ga-fact-check`
