# Georgia Case Deadlines

> court's actual holiday closures and the assigned judge's standing
> orders before treating any computed date as final.

Use this skill to compute deadlines under Georgia's time-computation
rule (O.C.G.A. § 1-3-1(d)(3), incorporated into the Civil Practice Act
by O.C.G.A. § 9-11-6(a)), the Georgia legal-holiday list (O.C.G.A.
§ 1-4-1), and the named civil-procedure and statute-of-limitation rules
encoded in `scripts/case-calendar.py`.

## Time computation — O.C.G.A. § 1-3-1(d)(3) / § 9-11-6(a)

Georgia counts time intervals stated in its statutes and rules as
follows:

1. **Exclude** the first day — the day of the triggering event (e.g.,
   the day of service).
2. **Count** every intermediate calendar day for periods of **7 days
   or more**, then adjust only the last day.
3. **Count** the **last** day, **unless** it falls on a **Saturday,
   Sunday, or O.C.G.A. § 1-4-1 legal holiday** — in which case the
   period runs through the **next business day**.
4. For a prescribed period of **fewer than 7 days**, **exclude**
   intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays from the count
   (effectively count only business days).

The roll-forward at the end can only extend a deadline; it never
shortens one. A "minus" period (e.g., a notice that must be served a
minimum number of days *before* an event) counts backward under the
same rule.

## Georgia legal holidays — O.C.G.A. § 1-4-1

Georgia sets **exactly thirteen state-holiday days each year** by
gubernatorial proclamation. O.C.G.A. § 1-4-1(a) adopts the federal
public holidays as they existed on **January 1, 2022**, plus the days
the Governor proclaims; the statute also requires the Governor to
include one of **January 19 / April 26 / June 3** among the
proclaimed days (the formerly named anchors, now published unlabeled
as "State Holiday").

### Predictable-rule holidays (auto-computed by the script)

| Holiday | Date |
|---|---|
| New Year's Day | January 1 |
| Martin Luther King, Jr. Day | 3rd Monday in January |
| Memorial Day | Last Monday in May |
| Juneteenth | June 19 (observed in Georgia) |
| Independence Day | July 4 |
| Labor Day | 1st Monday in September |
| Columbus Day | 2nd Monday in October (observed; not renamed) |
| Veterans Day | November 11 |
| Thanksgiving Day | 4th Thursday in November |
| Day after Thanksgiving | Friday after Thanksgiving (published "State Holiday") |
| Christmas Day | December 25 |

Fixed-date holidays follow federal observance: a Saturday holiday
shifts to the preceding Friday; a Sunday holiday shifts to the
following Monday.

### Floating "State Holiday" days (NOT auto-computed — verify each year)

These are proclamation-driven and vary year to year, so the script
does **not** include them:

- **Washington's Birthday** — statutorily a February federal holiday,
  but Georgia **defers** its observance to the **year-end cluster**
  (often **December 24**).
- **The spring "State Holiday"** — the date formerly published as
  Confederate Memorial Day, statutorily anchored near **April 26**.
- In some years a **second floating "State Holiday."**

> ⚠ **Verify late-April and late-December deadlines.** If a computed
> deadline lands on or near late April or late December, confirm the
> court's actual closure against the per-year schedule published at
> **georgia.gov** / the **Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC)**,
> because a floated holiday can push a rollover the script does not
> capture.

| `fbpa-demand` | FBPA written demand *before* filing suit | O.C.G.A. § 10-1-399(b) |

Key qualitative points the day counts encode:

- **Answer**: due 30 days after service (O.C.G.A. § 9-11-12(a)).
- **Default**: a case in default may be opened **as of right** (on
  payment of costs) within 15 days after default (O.C.G.A.
  § 9-11-55(a)); after that, only on the statutory showing.
- **Discovery responses**: 30 days, but a defendant served *with the
  summons* gets **45 days** after service of the summons
  (O.C.G.A. §§ 9-11-33 / 9-11-34 / 9-11-36). **Unanswered requests
  for admission are deemed admitted** (O.C.G.A. § 9-11-36(a)).
- **Summary judgment**: the motion must be served **at least 30 days
  before the hearing** (O.C.G.A. § 9-11-56(c)).
- **Dispossessory**: the tenant has **7 days** from service to answer
  (O.C.G.A. § 44-7-51(b)) — a sub-7-day-adjacent window where weekend
  / holiday handling matters.
- **Post-judgment**: motion for new trial, JNOV, and notice of appeal
  are each **30 days** (O.C.G.A. §§ 5-5-40, 9-11-50(b), 5-6-38(a)).
- **Dormancy / revival**: a judgment goes **dormant after 7 years**
  (O.C.G.A. § 9-12-60) and may be revived within **3 years** of
  dormancy (O.C.G.A. § 9-12-61).
- **FBPA**: a written **demand for relief** must be delivered **at
  least 30 days before** filing suit (O.C.G.A. § 10-1-399(b)); it is
  a prerequisite and does **not** toll the SOL.

## Statute of limitations — quick map

The day counts for multi-year SOLs are approximate (~365.25/yr);
always confirm the exact calendar date and check tolling/revival.

| Claim type | SOL | Authority | Rule key |
|---|---|---|---|
| Simple written contract | 6 years | O.C.G.A. § 9-3-24 | `sol-written-contract` |
| Credit-card debt (written cardmember agreement) | 6 years | O.C.G.A. § 9-3-24 | `sol-credit-card` |
| Open account / oral / implied | 4 years | O.C.G.A. § 9-3-25 | `sol-open-account` |
| Other contract (catch-all) | 4 years | O.C.G.A. § 9-3-26 | `sol-contract-catchall` |
| Personal injury | 2 years | O.C.G.A. § 9-3-33 | `sol-personal-injury` |
| Defamation / injury to reputation | 1 year | O.C.G.A. § 9-3-33 | `sol-defamation` |
| Trespass / damage to realty | 4 years | O.C.G.A. § 9-3-30 | `sol-realty` |
| Injury to / conversion / recovery of personalty | 4 years | O.C.G.A. §§ 9-3-31, 9-3-32 | `sol-personalty` |
| Fair Business Practices Act | 2 years | O.C.G.A. § 10-1-401 | `sol-fbpa` |
| FDCPA | 1 year | 15 U.S.C. § 1692k(d) | `sol-fdcpa` |
| FCRA | 2 years (from discovery; 5-yr repose) | 15 U.S.C. § 1681p | `sol-fcra-discovery` |
| TILA | 1 year | 15 U.S.C. § 1640(e) | `sol-tila` |

### Credit-card characterization — the live fight

A credit-card claim runs **6 years** as a *written contract* when the
plaintiff can produce the cardmember agreement and frame the card's
use as acceptance of those written terms (O.C.G.A. § 9-3-24). Where a
debt buyer **cannot** produce the written agreement and pleads the
claim as an **open account** or **account stated**, the **4-year** bar
of O.C.G.A. § 9-3-25 applies — often paired with a
proof / foundation defect. Identify which theory the complaint actually
pleads before computing the bar.

## Tolling and revival

- **Fraud**: O.C.G.A. § 9-3-96 tolls the period until the fraud is (or
  reasonably should have been) discovered.
- **New promise**: a new promise to pay a debt must be **in writing**
  to revive a barred claim (O.C.G.A. § 9-3-110).
- **Part payment**: a partial payment is treated as a new promise
  only when made on **written evidence** of the debt (O.C.G.A.
  § 9-3-112) — central in debt-buyer cases that rely on a recent
  payment to restart the clock.

## Examples

### "When is my answer due if I was served on Tuesday, April 15, 2025?"

```
$ python3 scripts/case-calendar.py --from 2025-04-15 --rule answer-due
Answer due — 30 days after service of summons and complaint
Deadline: ...
  From: Tuesday, April 15, 2025
  30 calendar days after
  Authority: O.C.G.A. § 9-11-12(a)
```

### "Is a credit-card debt that defaulted on March 15, 2019 time-barred?"

```
$ python3 scripts/case-calendar.py --from 2019-03-15 --rule sol-credit-card
SOL — credit-card debt on a written cardmember agreement ...
  From: Saturday, March 15, 2019
  ~6 years after
  Authority: O.C.G.A. § 9-3-24
```

If the plaintiff cannot produce the written agreement, also compute
the 4-year open-account bar:

```
$ python3 scripts/case-calendar.py --from 2019-03-15 --rule sol-open-account
```

### "List every named rule the calculator knows."

```
$ python3 scripts/case-calendar.py --rules
```

You can also compute an arbitrary interval:

```
$ python3 scripts/case-calendar.py --from 2025-04-15 --days 30 --mode calendar
$ python3 scripts/case-calendar.py --from 2025-04-15 --days 5 --mode court
```

## How `ga-deadlines` composes with the script

The skill body above is the reference. The arithmetic lives in
`scripts/case-calendar.py`, which:

- Encodes the predictable O.C.G.A. § 1-4-1 holidays and computes
  `ga_holidays(year)` for any year
- Implements the § 1-3-1(d)(3) roll-forward and the sub-7-day
  exclusion of intermediate weekends and holidays
- Provides `is_court_day(d)`, `add_calendar_days`, `add_court_days`
- Exposes a `RULES` dictionary mapping named keys to
  `(days, mode, description, authority)`

Use `--rules` for the canonical list and
`--from YYYY-MM-DD --rule <key>` for any specific computation.

## Composition

- For first-response timing (answer, default, defenses): `ga-first-30-days`
