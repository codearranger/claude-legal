  Matter-neutral reference hub for Georgia civil practice. Indexes the
  Georgia reference corpus — Uniform Court Rules (USCR + Uniform State
  Court Rules + Uniform Magistrate Court Rules + Supreme Court & Court
  of Appeals rules) and the O.C.G.A. chapters most used in civil,
  consumer, and family matters (Title 9 Civil Practice Act +
  limitations, Title 24 Evidence, Title 10 FBPA, Title 18 garnishment,
  Title 44 landlord-tenant + exemptions, Title 19 domestic relations,
  Title 15 courts, Title 11 UCC) — plus the shared federal corpora it
  symlinks. Triggers include "Georgia statute reference", "O.C.G.A.
  text", "look up O.C.G.A. §", "Georgia court rules", "USCR", "Uniform
  Superior Court Rule", "Georgia Civil Practice Act", "Georgia
  evidence rule", "Georgia statute of limitations", "look up Georgia

This is the **matter-neutral reference hub** for Georgia civil
practice. It is a pointer index: it tells the other `ga-` skills
where the rule text, statute text, and case authorities live, and
gives a curated topic map of the key Georgia authorities. It does
**not** reproduce statutory text — read the cited section in the
corpus or at an open source before relying on it.

The three symlinked directories point into the shared
`claude-legal-federal-laws` plugin; the federal text is not
duplicated per state. Georgia-specific text (`court-rules/`,
`ga-statutes-debt/`) stays in-plugin.

### Key cases (general civil + family)

Cite with the official reporter and the S.E.2d parallel (Georgia
still uses the official `Ga.` / `Ga. App.` reporters — there is no
public-domain neutral citation).

- **Lau's Corp., Inc. v. Haskins, 261 Ga. 491, 405 S.E.2d 474
  (1991)** — Celotex-style summary judgment; movant may point to the
  absence of evidence (governs § 9-11-56).
- **Stokes v. Stokes, 246 Ga. 765, 273 S.E.2d 169 (1980)** —
  Georgia is an equitable-distribution (not community-property)
  state for marital property.
- **Hill v. American Express, 289 Ga. App. 576, 657 S.E.2d 547
  (2008)** — credit-card debt is a written contract (6-year
  limitation under § 9-3-24).
- **Nyankojo v. North Star Capital Acquisition, 298 Ga. App. 6, 679
  S.E.2d 57 (2009)** — debt-buyer must prove an unbroken chain of
  assignment (the go-to for attacking debt-buyer standing).
- **Bowen v. Savoy, 308 Ga. 204, 839 S.E.2d 546 (2020)** — the
  "proper case" prong of § 9-11-55(b) needs no reasonable
  explanation.

## Citation conventions

- **Cases**: `Lau's Corp. v. Haskins, 261 Ga. 491, 405 S.E.2d 474
  (1991)` (Supreme Court); `Nyankojo v. North Star Capital
  Acquisition, 298 Ga. App. 6, 679 S.E.2d 57 (2009)` (Court of
  Appeals). Official `Ga.` / `Ga. App.` reporters plus the `S.E.2d`
  regional parallel — Georgia has not adopted a public-domain neutral
  citation, so always supply the reporter cite.
- **Statutes**: `O.C.G.A. § 9-11-56` (always with `§`; subsections
  `O.C.G.A. § 10-1-399(b)`).
- **Court rules**: `USCR 6.2` (Uniform Superior Court Rules); name
  the rule set for the others (e.g., "Uniform Magistrate Court Rule
  __", "Supreme Court of Georgia Rule __").
- **Federal**: `15 U.S.C. § 1692g(b)`; `12 C.F.R. § 1006.34`.

## Online sources

Open verification sources (Georgia has no free official statute-HTML
site; the official LexisNexis O.C.G.A. is paywalled and copyrighted,
so it is **not** scraped):

- **Statutes (O.C.G.A.)**:
  - FindLaw — `codes.findlaw.com/ga/` (current, scrapeable; primary
    open mirror for the puller).
  - Justia — `law.justia.com/codes/georgia/` (corroborating mirror;
    note Justia **403s automated fetch**, so it is a fallback/manual
    source, not the automated puller's target).
  - `ga.elaws.us/ocga/{title-chapter-section}` (usable but can lag;
    confirm currency against FindLaw).
- **Court rules**: `georgiacourts.gov` (and `assets.georgiacourts.gov`
  for dated USCR / Uniform Magistrate Court Rule PDFs); Council of
  Superior Court Judges at `cscj.georgiacourts.gov`; Supreme Court
  rules at `gasupreme.us/rules/`; Court of Appeals rules at
  `gaappeals.gov/court-rules/`.
- **Opinions**: `gasupreme.us/opinions/`, `gaappeals.gov/opinion-search/`,
  and CourtListener (court IDs **`ga`** = Supreme Court of Georgia,
  **`gactapp`** = Court of Appeals of Georgia).
- **County e-filing portals**: PeachCourt (`peachcourt.com`; Cobb,
  Gwinnett among others) and Odyssey eFileGA
  (`efilega.tylertech.cloud`; Fulton and many others); county-to-portal
  map at `georgiacourts.gov/efile-court-records/`.

## Legal data APIs

- **CourtListener / Legal Data Hunter MCP servers** — bundled by the
  shared `claude-legal-federal-laws` dependency (its `.mcp.json`) for
  live case-law lookup. Use court IDs `ga` and `gactapp` to scope to
  Georgia. These are the runtime path for "look up Georgia case law"
  — the snapshotted corpus carries statute and rule text, not the full
  opinion set.
- **Puller URL patterns** (used by the refresh scripts):
  - Statutes — `pull_georgia_statutes.py` (to be added): FindLaw
    (`codes.findlaw.com/ga/`), with Justia / `ga.elaws.us` as mirrors.
  - Court rules — `pull_georgia_rules.py` (to be added):
    `georgiacourts.gov` / `assets.georgiacourts.gov` PDFs plus the
    appellate-court rule pages.

## Composition

Every other `ga-` skill cites **into this corpus** for rule numbers,
statute sections, and case authorities rather than restating the law
itself. In particular:

- **`ga-fact-check`** — verifies the citations a draft relies on
  against this corpus (and the live MCP lookup for cases).
- **`ga-statewide-format`** — the pleading-form baseline
  (O.C.G.A. § 9-11-10 + the Uniform Court Rules indexed here).
- **`ga-deadlines`** — time computation (§ 1-3-1 / § 9-11-6) and the
  § 1-4-1 holiday set; this hub holds the limitation periods it pairs
  with.
- **`ga-consumer-debt`** — the FBPA, Installment Loan Act,
  garnishment, exemption, and SOL pointers above plus the federal
  symlinks.
- **`ga-family-law`** — the Title 19 domestic-relations pointers.

For the specific filing court, see the venue skills (`ga-fulton`,
`ga-cobb`, `ga-gwinnett`, `ga-county-courts`); for pro se conventions,
`ga-pro-se`.
