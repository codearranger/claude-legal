Use this skill in addition to `ga-statewide-format` whenever the case
is in a Fulton County trial court. The **Atlanta Judicial Circuit** is
a single-county circuit (Fulton County only). Pick the right court
first — Georgia splits trial jurisdiction by **subject matter**, not
by dollar amount.

## Which Fulton court

- **Superior Court of Fulton County** — general-jurisdiction trial
  court for the Atlanta Judicial Circuit; the largest superior bench
  in Georgia (reported at roughly 20 judges — *verify judge count
  against the current bench*). Organized into General Civil, Family,
  Criminal, and Business Case divisions. **Exclusive** over divorce,
  equity, title to land, and felonies (O.C.G.A. §§ 15-6-1, 15-6-8;
  Ga. Const. art. VI). Hears all civil matters not committed
  exclusively elsewhere.
- **State Court of Fulton County** — created by Ga. L. 1976 p. 3023,
  consolidating the now-defunct Civil Court and Criminal Court of
  Fulton County (the old Civil Court of Fulton County is historical;
  cite only for legacy matters). Reported at roughly 10 judges
  (*verify against the current bench*). Civil jurisdiction of **any
  amount** with no dollar ceiling (O.C.G.A. § 15-7-4), except the
  superior-exclusive subjects. Most debt-collection and tort suits
  are filed here.
- **Magistrate Court of Fulton County** — civil cap of **$15,000**
  (O.C.G.A. § 15-10-2), plus dispossessory and garnishment matters
  (the cap does not limit dispossessory money judgments). Fulton
  Magistrate is **mandatory e-file with no paper accepted**, including
  for dispossessory and garnishment filings.
- **Metro Atlanta Business Case Division (MABCD)** — a local business
  docket; the Fulton **State Court** joined effective January 2020.
  **No fixed dollar threshold**; cases come in by transfer through a
  selection committee. This is **distinct** from the statewide Georgia
  State-wide Business Court (O.C.G.A. § 15-5A), whose thresholds are
  generally ≥ $1,000,000 in real-property disputes or ≥ $500,000
  otherwise. Do not conflate the two.

## Caption

Name the specific court and "STATE OF GEORGIA" in the caption, with
the county in the court line (O.C.G.A. § 9-11-10(a)).

```
SUPERIOR COURT OF FULTON COUNTY
STATE OF GEORGIA

[PLAINTIFF NAME],
                              Plaintiff,
v.                                          Civil Action File No. __________

[DEFENDANT NAME],
                              Defendant.

                         [TITLE OF PLEADING]
```

For the State Court, substitute the court line with **"STATE COURT OF
FULTON COUNTY / STATE OF GEORGIA"**. The Georgia case-number
designation is **"Civil Action File No. ____"**; the number is
assigned by the clerk at filing — do not invent or guess it. Party
designations are Plaintiff/Defendant in civil actions and
Petitioner/Respondent in divorce and family matters.

## E-filing — eFileGA / PeachCourt

Fulton civil filings run through **eFileGA / PeachCourt**, the
electronic-filing portal built on the Tyler Odyssey backbone.
E-filing is **mandatory** for Superior, State, and Magistrate civil
cases under SB 407 (statewide civil e-file mandate, effective on or
about January 1, 2019). Confirm the current portal entry point and
document codes with the Clerk of Superior and Magistrate Courts before
filing.

## Family Division — Automatic Domestic Standing Order

The Superior Court operates a dedicated **Family Division**. When a
domestic case is filed, an **Automatic Domestic Standing Order**
attaches and binds both parties on filing/service (typically
restraining dissipation of assets, changes to insurance, harassment,
and removal of children, among other terms). Read the operative
standing order in the case and route domestic mechanics through
`ga-family-court`.

## TRAP — per-judge Civil Standing Case Management Orders

Fulton Superior judges issue **individual Civil Standing Case
Management Orders** that govern motion practice, conferral, courtesy
copies, and scheduling for cases on that judge's calendar. These
control alongside — and sometimes tighten — the Uniform Superior Court
Rules. **Always read the assigned judge's standing order**, not just
the USCR, before drafting motions or setting anything. Judge counts,
division assignments, and addresses change; treat any specific count
or address here as **verify-against-current**.
