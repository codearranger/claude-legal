# Idaho — First 30 Days After Service

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Time is short. This skill helps a defendant
> sketch a response and surface the most important deadlines, but consult
> a licensed Idaho attorney about substantive defenses when possible.

Use this skill when the defendant has **just been served** with a civil
summons and complaint in **District Court** or the **Magistrate
Division**. It frames the response window: the time in which the
defendant must answer, move to dismiss, or risk default. Pull verbatim
rule text from `../id-law-references/references/court-rules/`.

## The clock — I.R.C.P. 12(a)(1)(A)

> **★ 21 days.** A defendant served with a summons and complaint must
> serve an **answer within 21 days after service** (**I.R.C.P.
> 12(a)(1)(A)**).

Confirm against the current Rule 12(a) (it sets sub-deadlines by service
mode and posture) and compute the actual due date with `id-deadlines`
(I.R.C.P. 2.2 time computation + the 3-day mail add-on where the period
runs from service by mail). A timely pre-answer Rule 12(b) motion alters
the time to file a responsive pleading.

> ⚠ **Default risk.** If the defendant neither answers nor moves within
> the 21-day window, the plaintiff may apply for **entry of default**
> under Rule 55(a) and then seek a **default judgment** under Rule 55(b).
> Setting a default aside later is hard — see the Rule 55 section below
> and `id-post-judgment`.

## Playbook

### Days 0-3 — read the complaint, check the summons

- **Read every numbered paragraph.** Note who is suing, on what claims,
  for what relief, and what contracts / accounts / events are alleged.
- **Note the court, county, and case number** — these go on every filing
  (`id-statewide-format` caption).
- **Confirm the court level.** Civil claims of **$5,000 or less** are
  heard in the **Magistrate Division** (Idaho Code § 1-2208); claims
  **over $5,000** go to the **District Court**. Small Claims handles
  matters up to $5,000 (Idaho Code § 1-2301). The Magistrate Division
  also hears eviction, probate, and all family-law matters.
- **Check service** and the summons. Defective service / lack of personal
  jurisdiction is a defense — preserve it (Rule 12(b)(2), (4), (5)).
  Confirm the plaintiff served the summons within the **182-day** filing
  window (I.R.C.P. 4(b)(2)).

### Days 3-10 — choose the response strategy

Three principal paths: (1) **Answer** under Rule 8 — admit, deny, or
plead lack of knowledge per paragraph (Rule 8(b)), state affirmative
defenses (Rule 8(c)), assert counterclaims (Rule 13); (2) **Motion to
Dismiss** under Rule 12(b), in lieu of an answer (grounds below); (3)
**Motion for a More Definite Statement** (Rule 12(e)) — disfavored.

> ⚠ **Plead affirmative defenses — Rule 8(c).** Idaho requires a party to
> **affirmatively state** any avoidance or affirmative defense in the
> responsive pleading; defenses omitted from the answer can be **waived**.
> This includes statute of limitations, release, payment, accord and
> satisfaction, statute of frauds, res judicata, and lack of standing /
> chain of title. **Plead all that may apply.** Verify Rule 8(c) and the
> waiver consequences before filing.

### Motion to dismiss — Rule 12(b)

The Rule 12(b) grounds, raised by motion before or with the answer:

| Subrule | Ground |
|---|---|
| **(b)(1)** | lack of subject-matter jurisdiction |
| **(b)(2)** | lack of personal jurisdiction |
| **(b)(3)** | improper venue |
| **(b)(4)** | insufficient process |
| **(b)(5)** | insufficient service of process |
| **(b)(6)** | **failure to state a claim** upon which relief can be granted |
| **(b)(7)** | failure to join a party under Rule 19 |

> **Rule 12(b)(6) — tested on the pleadings; conversion to Rule 56.** A
> 12(b)(6) motion tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint on the
> **pleadings alone**, accepting well-pleaded allegations as true. **If
> matters outside the pleadings are presented and not excluded, the
> motion is treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56** with a
> reasonable opportunity to present Rule 56 material. Do not attach
> evidence to a 12(b)(6) motion unless you intend conversion; if a fact
> dispute matters, move under Rule 56. The summary-judgment standard and
> its 28-day / 14-day briefing timeline live in `id-draft-motion` and
> `id-deadlines`.

> **Preserve the threatened defenses.** Lack of personal jurisdiction,
> improper venue, insufficient process, and insufficient service can be
> **waived** if not raised in the first Rule 12 motion or the answer.
> Raise them at the first opportunity; verify the waiver rule in the
> corpus.

### Days 10-30 — draft the answer (or the motion)

#### Answer structure (Rule 8)

```
                              ANSWER,
                AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES, AND COUNTERCLAIM

   Defendant [Name] answers Plaintiff's Complaint as follows:

                              ANSWER
   1. Defendant admits the allegations in paragraph 1.
   2. Defendant denies the allegations in paragraph 2.
   3. Defendant lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a
      belief about the truth of paragraph 3, which has the effect of a
      denial.
   [...]

                       AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES
                   (Rule 8(c) — omission may waive)
   1. Plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations.
   2. Plaintiff lacks standing / chain of title to the alleged debt.
   3. [Release / payment / accord & satisfaction / statute of frauds /
      res judicata / failure to state a claim / etc.]

                            COUNTERCLAIM
   [If asserting one, plead it complaint-style with numbered factual
   allegations and named counts — Rule 13.]
```

#### Affirmative-defense catalog — Rule 8(c)

Plead **all** that may apply. Common Idaho defenses:

- Statute of limitations (very common — verify the period against
  `id-deadlines` / the relevant subject bundle: written contract 5 years
  (Idaho Code § 5-216); oral / open account 4 years (§ 5-217))
- Payment / accord and satisfaction / release
- Discharge in bankruptcy
- Statute of frauds
- Estoppel / waiver / laches
- Failure of consideration / fraud / illegality
- Res judicata / collateral estoppel (prior judgment)
- Lack of standing / chain of title (debt-buyer cases — see
  `id-consumer-debt`)
- Failure to state a claim (Rule 12(b)(6))

### Counterclaims and cross-claims — Rule 13

- **Rule 13(a) — compulsory counterclaim.** A pleader must state any
  counterclaim against the opposing party arising out of the
  **transaction or occurrence** that is the subject of the opposing
  party's claim, or the claim may be **barred** in later litigation.
  Plead all known related counterclaims with the answer.
- **Rule 13(b)** — permissive counterclaim (unrelated claims); **cross-
  claims** against co-parties are also governed by Rule 13. Verify the
  current text and scope of the bar.

### Entry of default and setting it aside — Rule 55

- **Rule 55(a) — entry of default.** When a defendant fails to plead or
  otherwise defend within the 21-day window, the plaintiff may apply for
  entry of default. **Treat any application for default as a hard signal
  to file the answer at once.**
- **Rule 55(b)** — default judgment entered after default.
- **Rule 55(c)** — setting aside an entry of default for **good cause**.
- **Setting aside a default *judgment*** is governed by **Rule 60(b)** and
  is a demanding standard — not a fallback for missing the answer window.
  Vacatur is developed in `id-post-judgment`.

## Filing the answer / motion

- **File** with the clerk of the District Court or Magistrate Division in
  the caption (e-file through **iCourt / Odyssey File & Serve
  (I.R.E.F.S.)** — mandatory for attorneys (Rule 4(a)), optional for
  self-represented filers (Rule 4(b))).
- **Serve** all parties under I.R.C.P. 5 with a certificate of service.
- **Sign** under Rule 11 (certifies the pleading is well-grounded;
  sanctions attach to violations).
