# Idaho Hearings

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Hearing-preparation aid only. Verify against the
> assigned judge's procedures, the court's local rules, and the court's
> current remote-appearance instructions before any hearing.

Use this skill alongside `id-statewide-format` and the specific venue
skill (`id-ada`, `id-bonneville`, `id-county-courts`) when preparing for,
attending, or following up on a hearing. Pull verbatim rule text from
`../id-law-references/references/court-rules/`.

## Motion practice and the Notice of Hearing — I.R.C.P. 7(b)

Civil motion practice is governed by **I.R.C.P. 7(b)**. Key mechanics:

- **Written motion + Notice of Hearing.** A motion states the relief
  sought and the grounds with particularity. To get the motion heard,
  serve a **written motion and a Notice of Hearing**.
- **★ 14-day notice.** Under **I.R.C.P. 7(b)(3)**, a written motion and
  notice of the hearing must be **served at least 14 days before the
  time specified for the hearing**, unless the rule or an order shortens
  the time. Compute that date with `id-deadlines` (add the I.R.C.P. 2.2
  mail add-on where the period runs from service by mail).
- **Reserve the date first.** Unlike a self-set motion day, the hearing
  date is typically coordinated with the court or the assigned judge's
  clerk before the Notice of Hearing issues — see `id-schedule-hearing`.
- **Supporting papers.** Support a motion with a **Memorandum** and any
  **Affidavit** or declaration; the opposing party files a responsive
  memorandum and the movant may reply. Confirm the briefing intervals and
  any page limits in the corpus.

> Summary-judgment motions run on a distinct timeline under I.R.C.P. 56
> (motion at least 90 days before trial; motion + brief served at least
> 28 days before the hearing; answering brief at least 14 days before the
> hearing). See `id-draft-motion` and `id-deadlines`.

```
                       NOTICE OF HEARING

   TO: [Opposing party / counsel]

   PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that the undersigned will bring the foregoing
   [Motion to ___] on for hearing before the above-entitled Court at
   the [County] Courthouse, [address], on [DATE] at [TIME], or as soon
   thereafter as counsel may be heard.

   DATED this ___ day of __________, 20__.
                                          ___________________________
                                          [Name], [Pro Se / Attorney]
```

## Remote and telephonic appearances

Idaho courts conduct many proceedings by **video (Zoom) or telephone** at
the court's discretion; remote appearances are widely available for
status conferences, oral argument, and some evidentiary hearings.

> Agent behavior: do **not** assume a platform or a meeting ID. Whether a
> hearing is in-person, video, or telephonic is set by the court's
> current practice and the assigned judge. **Confirm the court's current
> remote-appearance practice** and pull the link / dial-in from the
> court's website or the most recent notice. Meeting IDs change — never
> cache or guess them.

If the hearing is remote, the general etiquette holds:

- Join **early** (10-15 minutes) using the court's published link/number.
- Use your **full legal name** as the display name.
- **Mute** on entry; unmute only when addressed.
- **Camera on** unless the court directs otherwise.
- **Quiet, professional background**; test audio and video first.

## In-person hearings — etiquette

The District Court is presided over by a **district judge**; the
Magistrate Division by a **magistrate judge**. Etiquette is the same in
both:

- Arrive **early** (30 minutes) to clear security.
- **Dress** in business attire; self-represented filers should wear
  business-casual at minimum (no shorts, hats, or athletic wear).
- **Phones** silenced and put away.
- **Stand** when addressing the court ("May it please the Court, Your
  Honor").
- Address the judge as **"Your Honor"**; refer to the opposing party by
  **"Mr./Ms. [surname]"** from the podium.

## Hearing-day packet — what to bring

| Item | Purpose |
|---|---|
| 2 paper copies of each filing (court + opposing party) | Even in e-filed (iCourt / Odyssey) cases, have hard copies at the podium |
| Judge's courtesy copy (if local rule / procedures require one) | Some courts want a courtesy copy in advance |
| The relevant I.R.C.P. / I.R.E. excerpts (printed, tabbed) | Have the governing rule text at hand (see `id-law-references`) |
| Key cases (printed; note Court of Appeals "(Ct. App. YEAR)" cites) | Flag the dispositive authorities |
| Witness outlines (if evidentiary) | One per witness; sequential exam outline |
| Exhibit list + copies | Original + court copy + opposing-party copy of each exhibit |
| Proposed order / form of judgment (1 copy + 1 spare) | The court may sign at the hearing; see `id-submit-order` |
| Notepad + 2 pens | Notes during the hearing |

## Oral argument — structure

A workable structure for an Idaho civil motion:

1. **Opening** (~30 sec). "May it please the Court, [Name] for the
   [Plaintiff / Defendant]. This is [Movant]'s Motion to [Dismiss /
   Compel / for Summary Judgment]. We respectfully ask the Court to
   [grant / deny] for [N] reasons."
2. **Roadmap** (~30 sec). "First... Second... Third..."
3. **Substantive argument** — lead with the strongest point; cite the
   governing I.R.C.P., I.R.E., or case; tie back to the record.
4. **Address counter-arguments candidly** — answer the court's questions
   directly; do not duck weaknesses.
5. **Reserve rebuttal** if you are the movant.
6. **Closing** (~15 sec). "For these reasons, [Movant] respectfully asks
   the Court to [grant / deny]. Thank you, Your Honor."

## Evidentiary hearings — special considerations

For evidentiary hearings (injunctions, contempt, post-judgment debtor
exams, disputed-fact motions):

- **Subpoena witnesses** in advance under I.R.C.P. 45.
- **Pre-mark exhibits** per the court's numbering convention.
- **Witness exclusion** — request under I.R.E. 615 if helpful.
- **Stipulations** — confer beforehand to stipulate to undisputed facts
  and to authentication of routine business records under I.R.E. 803(6) /
  902 (see `id-law-references`).
- **Record** — confirm with the clerk how the proceeding is recorded (and
  how the record is made for a remote/telephonic hearing).

## Continuances

- **Confer with the opposing party first** — stipulated or unopposed
  motions to continue are far more likely to be granted.
- File the motion / stipulation **before** the setting, stating the
  current date, the reason, whether the opposing party agrees, and
  proposed new dates. Many courts want a proposed order.

## Composition

- For format: `id-statewide-format`
- For courthouse logistics (location, security, division): `id-ada`,
  `id-bonneville`, `id-county-courts`
- For reserving / noticing the hearing: `id-schedule-hearing`
- For drafting the motion and supporting papers: `id-draft-motion`,
  `id-draft-declaration`, `id-draft-note`
- For the post-hearing order: `id-submit-order`
- For deadline arithmetic (the 14-day notice and briefing windows):
  `id-deadlines`
- For canonical I.R.C.P. / I.R.E. text and local rules:
  `id-law-references`
