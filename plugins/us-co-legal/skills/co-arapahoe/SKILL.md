  Center". Covers the three Arapahoe courthouse locations
  (Centennial, Aurora, Littleton), the 18th JD local civil-practice
  standards, the multi-county venue rules that distinguish Arapahoe
  from neighboring Douglas County District Court, and the chambers
  preferences for the principal civil divisions. Layer on top of

# Arapahoe County District Court (18th Judicial District)

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Drafting and filing guidance only. Verify
> every step against the current 18th JD local rules and chambers
> preferences before filing.

Use this skill in addition to `co-statewide-format` when the case is
in the **Arapahoe County District Court**, part of the **18th
Judicial District** (which also covers **Douglas, Elbert, and
Lincoln** counties — though Douglas County District Court will
become its own JD as a result of HB22-1210 separation; verify
current effective date before relying on cross-county practice).

The 18th JD is the second-busiest judicial district in Colorado by
civil-case volume after Denver and El Paso.

## Three courthouse locations

| Courthouse | Address | Use |
|------------|---------|-----|
| **Arapahoe County District Court — Centennial** | 7325 S. Potomac St., Centennial, CO 80112 | Principal civil court; most CV cases filed here |
| **Aurora Municipal Justice Center (state)** | 14999 E. Alameda Pkwy., Aurora, CO 80012 | Some Arapahoe County Court matters, traffic, evictions |
| **Robert A. Christensen Justice Center — Littleton** | 1790 W. Littleton Blvd., Littleton, CO 80120 | Domestic relations, juvenile, mental health |

The principal civil filing location is the **Centennial courthouse**.
The court's website publishes assignment-by-courtroom information.

                  MOTION TO DISMISS
              (UNDER C.R.C.P. 12(b)(5))
```

Case numbers follow the standard `YYYYCV0#####` format. The Division
identifies the assigned judge's chambers; the Courtroom identifies
the physical hearing room (rooms 200-series are on the second floor,
400-series on the fourth floor of the Centennial courthouse).

## Authoritative source — pull the current chambers info every time

The 18th JD publishes its current chambers roster, courtroom
assignments, and judges' practice standards at:

**https://www.coloradojudicial.gov/courts/judicial-districts/18th-judicial-district**

**Agent behavior**: before drafting a notice, scheduling a hearing,
or formatting a chambers-copy cover sheet, fetch the current
division-to-judge mapping and the assigned judge's practice
standards. The 18th JD rotates civil-domestic-criminal assignments
periodically, and chambers preferences (e.g., chambers copy
required for any motion over 25 pages, courtesy email of proposed
orders in Word format) vary by judge.

## Motion practice — C.R.C.P. 121 § 1-15 + local conventions

Statewide C.R.C.P. 121 § 1-15 timing applies as in Denver:

- **Response**: 21 days after service
- **Reply**: 7 days after service of the response
- **Page limits**: 15 (motion / response), 10 (reply); leave required
  for excess

**18th JD distinctives:**

- Most Arapahoe District judges require a **certificate of conferral**
  (C.R.C.P. 121 § 1-15(8)) even for some borderline-dispositive
  motions — practice is to confer and certify even when in doubt.
- **Chambers copies**: some judges require courtesy copies for
  motions exceeding 20-25 pages. Always check the judge's practice
  standards; if required, deliver to the chambers office on the
  same day as e-filing.
- **Proposed orders**: many judges request a **Word-format**
  proposed order emailed directly to chambers in addition to the
  PDF filed through CCEFS. The cover sheet on the chambers copy
  should note "Proposed Order also emailed in Word format."

## Case management — C.R.C.P. 16(b)

The 18th JD follows the C.R.C.P. 16(b) timeline. The clerk's office
sets an **initial case-management conference** approximately 49 days
after the case is at issue. The parties file a **joint proposed
Case Management Order** 7 days before the CMC. The court holds the
CMC by phone or, in complex cases, in-person at the assigned
courtroom.

## Filing — CCEFS

Same as statewide. The 18th JD requires e-filing for represented
parties; pro se filers may file by paper or use CCEFS Pro Se.

Civil filing fees match the statewide schedule (C.R.S. § 13-32-101).

## Service of process

C.R.C.P. 4 service deadlines apply (63 days from complaint filing).
The Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office processes civil service
requests for in-county service; private process servers are used
extensively in the 18th JD.

## Document set for a noted motion

Identical to Denver (see `co-denver`):

1. Motion (with title in ALL CAPS citing the rule)
2. Supporting affidavit/declaration(s) with exhibits
3. Certificate of Conferral (C.R.C.P. 121 § 1-15(8))
4. Proposed Order (separate document; some judges require an
   additional Word-format email copy)
5. Certificate of Service

## Pro se resources

The 18th JD operates a **Self-Help Center** at the Centennial
courthouse. JDF forms (see `co-pro-se`) are universally accepted
for pro se filings.

## Composition

- For statewide format: `co-statewide-format`
- For motion drafting: `co-draft-motion`
- For scheduling: `co-schedule-hearing`
- For filing mechanics: `co-file-packet`
- For pro se workflows: `co-pro-se`
- For Denver matters (the other principal Colorado civil court):
  `co-denver`
