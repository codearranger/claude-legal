# Colorado Discovery

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** This skill helps draft and respond to
> discovery. Verify against current C.R.C.P. and the assigned
> judge's practice standards before serving or filing.

Use this skill in addition to `co-statewide-format`,
`co-law-references`, and (where applicable) `co-first-30-days`. The
Colorado discovery framework derives from **C.R.C.P. 26-37** in
district court, with simplified parallel provisions in **county
court** under **C.R.C.P. 311**.

## Snapshot — Colorado discovery clock

| Trigger | Deadline / event | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Case at issue (last responsive pleading filed) | C.R.C.P. 16 / 26 clock starts | C.R.C.P. 16(b) |
| Rule 26(f) conference | ≥ 14 days before CMC | C.R.C.P. 26(f) |
| Joint Proposed CMO | 7 days before CMC | C.R.C.P. 16(b)(2) |
| Initial Case Management Conference | ~ 49 days after at-issue | C.R.C.P. 16(b) |
| Rule 26(a)(1) initial disclosures | 28 days after at-issue | C.R.C.P. 26(a)(1) |
| Written discovery responses | 30 days after service | C.R.C.P. 33(a), 34(b), 36(a) |
| Expert disclosures — affirmative | 91 days before trial | C.R.C.P. 26(a)(2)(C)(I) |
| Expert disclosures — rebuttal | 56 days before trial | C.R.C.P. 26(a)(2)(C)(II) |
| Trial witness list / final disclosures | 28 days before trial | C.R.C.P. 26(a)(3) |
| Discovery cutoff | 49 days before trial (default) | C.R.C.P. 16(b)(8) — modifiable in CMO |

## Initial disclosures — C.R.C.P. 26(a)(1)

Within **28 days after the case is at issue**, each party must
disclose **without awaiting a discovery request**:

1. **Witnesses** with discoverable information — name, address, phone,
   email, and subjects
2. **Documents** that the disclosing party may use to support its
   claims or defenses
3. **Damages computation** with documents supporting it
4. **Insurance agreements** that may indemnify

C.R.C.P. 26(a)(1) initial disclosures are **automatic** in district
court. They are **NOT** required in county court (C.R.C.P. 311 has
no parallel provision) — county court discovery is limited and
court-directed.

## Interrogatories — C.R.C.P. 33

Colorado **DOES** allow written interrogatories (unlike Oregon, which
does not). The presumptive limit is **25 written interrogatories**
per side, counting discrete subparts (C.R.C.P. 33(a)(2)).

- Service: any time after the case is at issue
- Response due: **30 days** after service (C.R.C.P. 33(a)(3))
- Form: each interrogatory answered separately, under oath, with any
  objection stated specifically
- Excess interrogatories: require **leave of court**

```
INTERROGATORIES

Pursuant to C.R.C.P. 33, [Defendant] requests that [Plaintiff]
answer the following Interrogatories in writing under oath and serve
them upon the undersigned within 30 days of service.

INTERROGATORY NO. 1: State the name, address, and current employer
of each person who has knowledge of the facts pleaded in your
Complaint.

ANSWER:
[Response]

INTERROGATORY NO. 2: [...]
```

## Requests for Production — C.R.C.P. 34

- Service: any time after the case is at issue
- Response due: **30 days** after service (C.R.C.P. 34(b)(2)(A))
- Production format: native if requested; otherwise reasonably
  usable
- ESI handling: parallel to Federal Rule 34 — preserve metadata
  unless waived

## Requests for Admission — C.R.C.P. 36

- Service: any time after the case is at issue
- Response due: **30 days** after service (35 days with the
  C.R.C.P. 6(e) mail-extension)
- **Critical**: silence = admission. A party that fails to timely
  deny or object to an RFA admits it for purposes of the litigation
  (C.R.C.P. 36(a))
- Cannot be more than 50 in number absent leave (C.R.C.P. 36(a))

## Depositions — C.R.C.P. 30

- Limit: **one deposition per witness per side** without leave
  (C.R.C.P. 30(a)(2)(A)(ii))
- Length: **6 hours** absent agreement or court order (C.R.C.P.
  30(d)(1) — Colorado parallel to FRCP 30(d)(1))
- Notice: must serve **reasonable** advance notice; 10-14 days is
  customary
- Remote: depositions by **video conference** permitted by stipulation
  or court order under C.R.C.P. 30(b)(4)

## Subpoenas — C.R.C.P. 45

- Subpoena issuance: by party's attorney or pro se signatory
- Non-party document subpoena: serve **notice on opposing parties**
  10 days before service on the third party (C.R.C.P. 45(b)(1))
- Court reporter required for testimony subpoenas; party requesting
  bears witness/mileage fees

## Meet-and-confer — C.R.C.P. 121 § 1-12 and § 1-15(8)

Colorado **requires conferral** before filing most discovery motions:

- **C.R.C.P. 121 § 1-15(8)**: non-dispositive motions require a
  conferral statement
- **C.R.C.P. 121 § 1-12**: discovery disputes specifically
  contemplate informal resolution before motion practice

A typical meet-and-confer email:

```
Subject: Conferral re: Discovery Responses — [Case Short Title],
         Case No. [Number]

[Counsel Name],

This email constitutes the conferral required by C.R.C.P. 121
§ 1-15(8) before I file a Motion to Compel.

Your client's responses to my client's First Set of Interrogatories
and Requests for Production, served on [DATE], are deficient in the
following respects:

  1. Interrogatory No. 3 — Boilerplate objection ("vague, overly
     broad, unduly burdensome") without specifying which terms are
     vague or quantifying the burden. C.R.C.P. 26(b)(5) requires
     particularity.

  2. RFP No. 7 — No documents produced; response states "no
     non-privileged responsive documents exist." But Plaintiff's
     Complaint refers to documents that fall squarely within this
     request.

  [...]

I propose the following resolution: [specific proposal]. Please
respond by [date 7-10 days out] confirming whether your client will
provide supplemental responses. If I do not hear back, I will
proceed with a Motion to Compel under C.R.C.P. 37(a).

Best regards,
[Name]
```

Save copies of all conferral attempts. The court will not entertain a
motion to compel that lacks a credible conferral effort.

## Motion to compel — C.R.C.P. 37(a)

If conferral fails, file a motion to compel. The motion must:

1. **State the specific deficiencies** (which interrogatory / RFP /
   RFA and why the response is inadequate)
2. **Attach the discovery requests and responses** as exhibits
3. **Document the conferral attempt** in a separate Certificate of
   Conferral under C.R.C.P. 121 § 1-15(8)
4. **Quote and dispute each objection** under C.R.C.P. 26(b)(5)'s
   particularity requirement
5. **Request specific relief**: an order compelling responses by a
   date certain, an order awarding costs and fees under C.R.C.P.
   37(a)(5), or an order striking objections

The opposing party has 21 days to respond (C.R.C.P. 121 § 1-15);
movant may reply within 7 days.

### Sanctions under C.R.C.P. 37(a)(5) and 37(b)

- **37(a)(5)**: court "**must**" award expenses and fees to the
  prevailing party on a successful motion to compel unless the
  non-movant's position was substantially justified or other
  circumstances make an award unjust
- **37(b)**: stronger sanctions for disobedience to a discovery order
  — including striking pleadings, default judgment, contempt

## Discovery in county court — C.R.C.P. 311

County-court civil cases (under $25,000) follow a **simplified**
discovery framework under C.R.C.P. 311:

- **No presumptive C.R.C.P. 26(a)(1) initial disclosures**
- **Limited interrogatories** — by court order only
- **Subpoena power** under C.R.C.P. 345 (county court version)
- **Trial typically within 90-120 days** of at-issue; little time
  for protracted discovery

This is the discovery framework in **consumer debt-buyer cases**
filed in county court — see `co-consumer-debt` for the
discovery-strategy guidance specific to debt-buyer defense.

## Privilege log — C.R.C.P. 26(b)(5)

When withholding any document on the basis of privilege, the
producing party must serve a **privilege log** describing the nature
of the withheld document(s) so the requesting party can assess the
claim. The log must include:

- Date
- Author / recipient
- Subject matter (general)
- Privilege asserted

Insufficient privilege logs are sanctionable — see *Trotter v. 7R
Holdings*, 873 F.3d 1010 (10th Cir. 2017) (analogous Colorado
practice).
