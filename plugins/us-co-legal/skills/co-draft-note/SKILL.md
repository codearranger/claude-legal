  This skill should be used to scaffold a Colorado scheduling
  document — typically a Notice of Setting (issued by the court),
  Notice of Hearing (when permitted by local rule), or a related
  scheduling notice placed on the court's calendar. Triggers include
  "draft a Colorado notice of hearing", "Colorado notice of setting",
  "draft a notice to appear", "scheduling document Colorado",
  "Colorado calendar notice". Note that in Colorado the court itself
  typically issues a Notice of Setting after the parties brief a
  motion; the parties do not self-schedule the way Washington's "Note
  for Motion Docket" works. This skill therefore drafts the variants
  the parties actually file: Notice of Hearing (court-set hearing
  echoed to the parties), Notice of Withdrawal, Notice of Filing,
  Notice of Substitution of Counsel, and similar party-filed
  notices.

# Draft a Colorado Notice

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** This skill scaffolds a notice document.
> Verify the assigned judge's practice standards and the C.R.C.P.
> rules controlling the specific notice type before filing.

In Colorado civil practice, the **court** typically issues a Notice
of Setting after a motion is fully briefed; the **parties** do not
self-schedule the way they do in some other states (contrast
Washington's Note for Motion Docket). However, several party-filed
notices are common in Colorado practice — this skill covers the
typical formats.

## Notice types in Colorado civil practice

| Notice | Filer | Purpose | Authority |
|--------|-------|---------|-----------|
| Notice of Setting | Court | Court announces it has set a hearing on a previously filed motion | C.R.C.P. 121 § 1-15(4) |
| Notice of Hearing | Filer (when self-scheduling permitted, esp. county court / certain post-judgment) | Notifies parties of a hearing date | C.R.C.P. 121 § 1-15 |
| Notice of Filing | Filer | Cover document accompanying a discrete filing (often unnecessary in e-filed cases) | None specific |
| Notice of Substitution of Counsel | New counsel | Substitutes lead counsel | C.R.C.P. 121 § 1-1 |
| Notice of Withdrawal of Counsel | Withdrawing counsel | Counsel withdraws (subject to court approval if trial imminent) | C.R.C.P. 121 § 1-1(3) |
| Notice of Limited Appearance | Limited-scope counsel | Appearance for a specific event or issue | Colo. R. Prof. Conduct 1.2(c); C.R.C.P. 11(b) |
| Notice of Address Change | Pro se party / counsel | Updates service address | C.R.C.P. 121 § 1-1(4) |
| Notice of Dismissal | Plaintiff (before answer) | Voluntary dismissal under C.R.C.P. 41(a)(1) | C.R.C.P. 41(a)(1) |
| Notice of Appeal | Appellant | Triggers appellate jurisdiction | C.A.R. 3, 4 |

## Notice of Dismissal — C.R.C.P. 41(a)(1)

A plaintiff may **voluntarily dismiss** the action without leave of
court **before** the defendant has answered or moved for summary
judgment. After that, dismissal requires a court order under
C.R.C.P. 41(a)(2) or a stipulation under 41(a)(1)(B).

```
                       NOTICE OF DISMISSAL
                  (UNDER C.R.C.P. 41(a)(1)(A))

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that Plaintiff hereby voluntarily dismisses this
action [without prejudice / with prejudice]. No Defendant has filed
an answer or motion for summary judgment, and dismissal under
C.R.C.P. 41(a)(1)(A) is therefore proper without a court order.

The undersigned files this Notice as of right.

                                        [Plaintiff / Counsel
                                         signature block]
```

> ⚠ **Two-dismissal rule**: a second voluntary dismissal of the
> same claim under C.R.C.P. 41(a)(1) operates as an **adjudication
> on the merits** — that is, with prejudice. Track prior dismissals
> before filing a second voluntary dismissal.

## Notice of Appeal — C.A.R. 3

A separate set of rules (the Colorado Appellate Rules) govern the
Notice of Appeal; see `co-post-judgment` for the timing and the form
of the notice. Briefly:

- **Filed in the trial court**, not the appellate court
- **Within 49 days** of entry of judgment (C.A.R. 4(a))
- **Form**: see C.A.R. 3.4 for content requirements; pro se filers
  can use **JDF 1402**
