# Colorado — First 30 Days After Service

> when possible.

Use this skill when the defendant has **just been served** with a
civil complaint, petition, or notice. It frames the first 30 days
after service — the window in which the defendant must answer,
move to dismiss, or risk default.

## The clock

C.R.C.P. 12(a) sets the answer deadline:

| Defendant | Deadline | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Colorado resident, in-state personal service | **21 days** after service | C.R.C.P. 12(a)(1) |
| Out-of-state defendant, personally served | **35 days** after service | C.R.C.P. 12(a)(2) |
| Service by publication / mail (when court order) | **35 days** | C.R.C.P. 4(g) / 12(a)(3) |
| Counterclaim or cross-claim (reply) | **21 days** | C.R.C.P. 12(a)(3) |
| Response to amended complaint | **14 days** (or remainder of original time, whichever is longer) | C.R.C.P. 15(a) |

Compute with `co-deadlines` — the C.R.C.P. 6(a)(1)(C) roll-forward
applies if the deadline lands on a Saturday, Sunday, or Colorado
legal holiday.

> ⚠ **Default risk**: if the defendant does not answer or move
> within the window, the plaintiff may move for **default
> judgment** under C.R.C.P. 55(b). Once entered, default is hard
> (but not impossible — see `co-post-judgment` on C.R.C.P. 60(b)) to
> set aside.

## Day-by-day playbook

### Days 0-3 — read the complaint carefully

- **Read every paragraph**. Note who is suing, on what claims, for
  what relief. List the alleged contracts, accounts, or events.
- **Note the case number, court, and division** — these go on every
  response.
- **Note the case type**:
  - `CV` district court civil
  - `C0` county court civil (≤ $25,000)
  - `S0` small claims (≤ $7,500)
  - `DR` domestic relations
  - `PR` probate
- **Check service**. Was the defendant **personally served**? Left
  with someone at the residence? Posted on the door? Service
  defects are gold-standard defenses — see C.R.C.P. 4 and
  *Goodman Assocs., LLC v. WP Mountain Props., LLC*, 222 P.3d 310
  (Colo. 2010).

### Days 3-10 — choose the response strategy

The defendant has three principal paths:

1. **Answer** — admit, deny, or claim lack of knowledge for each
   numbered paragraph; assert affirmative defenses; assert any
   counterclaims.
2. **Motion to Dismiss** under C.R.C.P. 12(b) — challenges the
   pleading without answering on the merits. If the motion is
   denied, the answer is then due **14 days** after the order
   (C.R.C.P. 12(a)(4)).
3. **Motion for More Definite Statement** under C.R.C.P. 12(e) — when
   the complaint is so vague the defendant cannot reasonably respond.
   Rarely useful; courts disfavor.

### C.R.C.P. 12(b) defenses — when to move to dismiss

C.R.C.P. 12(b) lists seven defenses that may be raised by motion
instead of (or in addition to) the answer:

- **12(b)(1)** lack of subject matter jurisdiction
- **12(b)(2)** lack of personal jurisdiction
- **12(b)(3)** improper venue
- **12(b)(4)** insufficient process
- **12(b)(5)** failure to state a claim upon which relief can be
  granted (the most common — Colorado's analog to FRCP 12(b)(6))
- **12(b)(6)** insufficient service of process
- **12(b)(7)** failure to join a party under C.R.C.P. 19

A C.R.C.P. 12(b)(5) motion is the most common pre-answer motion;
Colorado applies the **Twombly/Iqbal-equivalent plausibility
standard** under *Warne v. Hall*, 2016 CO 50, replacing the older
"no set of facts" test.

> ⚠ **Defense waiver**: 12(b)(2), (3), (4), (5) defenses are waived
> if not raised in the first responsive pleading (C.R.C.P. 12(h)).
> 12(b)(1) and (b)(7) are not waivable.

### Days 10-21 — draft the answer (or the motion)

#### Answer structure

```
                  ANSWER, AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES,
                       AND COUNTERCLAIMS

Defendant John Doe (the "Defendant"), pro se, responds to
Plaintiff's Complaint as follows:

                          ANSWER

1. Defendant denies the allegations in paragraph 1.

2. Defendant lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a
   belief about the truth of the allegations in paragraph 2 and
   therefore denies them.

3. Defendant admits the allegations in paragraph 3.

[...]

                  AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES

4. First Affirmative Defense — Statute of Limitations.
   Plaintiff's claims are barred in whole or in part by the
   applicable statute of limitations under C.R.S. § 13-80-103.5.

5. Second Affirmative Defense — Failure to State a Claim.
   Plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be
   granted under C.R.C.P. 12(b)(5).

[...]

                       COUNTERCLAIMS

[If asserting counterclaims, plead them as a separate complaint-
style block with numbered factual allegations and named claims.]

                          PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff;
B. Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint with prejudice;
C. Award Defendant attorneys' fees and costs as allowed by law;
D. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.
```

#### Standard affirmative-defense catalog (C.R.C.P. 8(c))

Plead all that may apply; failure to plead an affirmative defense in
the answer typically waives it.

- Accord and satisfaction
- Arbitration / award
- Assumption of risk
- Comparative negligence
- Discharge in bankruptcy
- Duress
- Estoppel
- Failure of consideration
- Fraud
- Illegality
- Injury by fellow servant
- Laches
- License
- Payment
- Release
- Res judicata / claim preclusion
- Statute of frauds
- **Statute of limitations** (very common; see SOL chart below)
- Waiver

**Subject-matter-specific defenses** (use `co-consumer-debt` for the
full debt-buyer affirmative-defense list, including standing/chain of
title, CFDCPA licensure, account stated, lack of meeting of the
minds, etc.).

### Statute of limitations — Colorado quick chart

| Claim | SOL | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Liquidated debt / written instrument | **6 years** | C.R.S. § 13-80-103.5(1)(a) |
| Tort and most general civil actions | **2 years** | C.R.S. § 13-80-102 |
| Personal injury motor vehicle | **3 years** | C.R.S. § 13-80-101(1)(n) |
| Fraud, breach of fiduciary duty | **3 years** | C.R.S. § 13-80-101(1)(c) |
| CCPA (Consumer Protection Act) | **3 years** from accrual | C.R.S. § 6-1-115 |
| CFDCPA (state debt-collection law) | **1 year** from violation | C.R.S. § 5-16-113(4) |
| FDCPA (federal) | **1 year** from violation | 15 U.S.C. § 1692k(d) |
| Slander, libel | **1 year** | C.R.S. § 13-80-103(1)(a) |

### Counterclaims

C.R.C.P. 13 governs counterclaims:

- **Compulsory counterclaim** (13(a)): any claim arising out of the
  same transaction or occurrence — **must** be pleaded or it is
  waived
- **Permissive counterclaim** (13(b)): unrelated claim — may be
  pleaded
- A pro se filer should plead **all known counterclaims** at the
  time of answer; do not assume that something "isn't really part
  of this case" — Colorado courts apply compulsory-counterclaim
  preclusion strictly

### Cross-claims

C.R.C.P. 13(g) governs cross-claims against co-parties (same side
of the v.). Less common in two-party cases.

## Filing the answer / motion

- **E-file** through CCEFS (attorneys mandatory; pro se where
  available)
- **Pay the answer/response filing fee** (~$192 district court;
  lower in county court) or file JDF 205/206 for fee waiver
- **Serve the answer** on all parties per C.R.C.P. 5 (CCEFS
  e-service or by mail / hand delivery / email)
- **Include a Certificate of Service**

## After filing the answer

The case is now **at issue**, which triggers:

- C.R.C.P. 16(b) case-management clock starts
- C.R.C.P. 26(a)(1) initial disclosures due **28 days** after at-issue
- Initial CMC ~49 days after at-issue
- Discovery may now be served (see `co-discovery`)

## Composition

- For statewide format: `co-statewide-format`
- For drafting the answer / motion / declaration:
  `co-draft-motion`, `co-draft-declaration`
- For the specific court: `co-denver`, `co-arapahoe`,
  `co-county-courts`
- For deadlines arithmetic: `co-deadlines`
- For matter-specific defenses: `co-consumer-debt`, `co-family-law`
