# Colorado Post-Judgment Procedure

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** This skill addresses procedure once a
> Colorado judgment has been entered. Verify every step against
> current law before filing or responding.

Use this skill in addition to `co-statewide-format` when the case is
**past judgment** — whether you are attacking the judgment, defending
against collection, or collecting on it.

## Two paths after judgment

1. **Attack the judgment** — motions for new trial under C.R.C.P.
   59, relief from judgment under C.R.C.P. 60, appeal under C.A.R.
   3 and 4.
2. **Collect or resist collection** — supplemental proceedings under
   C.R.C.P. 69, garnishment under C.R.S. § 13-54.5, exemptions
   under C.R.S. § 13-54, debtor exam, judgment lien, eventual
   satisfaction or expiration.

## Attacking the judgment

### C.R.C.P. 59 — Motion for new trial / amend findings

- **Deadline**: 14 days after entry of judgment (C.R.C.P. 59(a))
- **Grounds**: error in law, irregularity in proceedings, newly
  discovered evidence, surprise, jury misconduct, etc.
- **Effect on appeal**: a timely C.R.C.P. 59 motion **tolls** the
  appeal deadline (C.A.R. 4(a)(2))

### C.R.C.P. 60(b) — Relief from final judgment

- **Deadlines**:
  - 60(b)(1) **mistake, inadvertence, surprise, excusable neglect**:
    within a reasonable time, **not more than 182 days** (≈ 6 months)
  - 60(b)(2) **newly discovered evidence**: same 182-day cap
  - 60(b)(3) **fraud, misrepresentation, misconduct**: same 182-day
    cap
  - 60(b)(4) **void judgment** (lack of jurisdiction, due process):
    no time limit
  - 60(b)(5) **judgment satisfied, released, or no longer equitable**:
    reasonable time
- **Most common use**: setting aside **default judgments** —
  particularly in consumer debt-buyer cases where the defendant was
  not properly served. *See* `co-consumer-debt` for the
  default-judgment attack template.
- **Standard for default**: "good cause" plus a meritorious defense;
  see *Goodman Assocs., LLC v. WP Mountain Props., LLC*, 222 P.3d 310
  (Colo. 2010)

### Notice of Appeal — C.A.R. 3 and 4

- **Deadline**: **49 days** from entry of judgment (C.A.R. 4(a)) —
  or 49 days from disposition of a timely C.R.C.P. 59 motion
- **Where to file**: Colorado Court of Appeals (state appeals);
  Colorado Supreme Court if direct review applies
- **Fees**: filing fee plus transcript and record fees
- **Pro se appeals**: JDF 1402 (limited jurisdiction); the
  Colorado Appellate Practice Guide is the leading reference

## Collecting / resisting collection

### Judgment lien — automatic on real estate

Under **C.R.S. § 13-52-102**, a judgment of a Colorado court
automatically becomes a **lien on the judgment debtor's real
property** in the county where the judgment is recorded with the
county clerk and recorder. Steps:

1. Obtain a **certified copy of the judgment** from the clerk
2. **Record** with the county clerk and recorder of any county where
   the debtor owns or might acquire real estate
3. The lien is good for **6 years** from the date of judgment and may
   be revived (see below)

### Writ of Continuing Garnishment — C.R.S. § 13-54.5-104

Wage garnishment is by **Writ of Continuing Garnishment**, which
attaches to **future earnings** for up to **6 months** at a time
before requiring renewal.

- **Form**: JDF 82 (Writ of Continuing Garnishment)
- **Amount**: up to **25% of disposable earnings per week** or **the
  amount by which weekly earnings exceed 40 × Colorado minimum
  wage**, whichever is less (C.R.S. § 13-54.5-101.5; mirrors federal
  CCPA but with Colorado-specific minimum-wage anchor)
- **Service**: serve on the **employer (garnishee)**; serve the
  **judgment debtor** by mail within 7 days
- **Garnishee's answer**: due within **7 days** of receipt (C.R.S.
  § 13-54.5-106(2))
- **Debtor's objection / claim of exemption**: within **14 days** of
  receipt of the writ

### Writ of Garnishment with Notice of Exemption — non-wage assets

For bank accounts and other non-wage assets, use the **Writ of
Garnishment** with the notice-of-exemption form (JDF 84). The debtor
has **14 days** to file a Claim of Exemption.

### Colorado exemptions — C.R.S. art. 54 of title 13

Colorado has a robust state-law exemption framework. Key exemptions:

| Item | Amount / scope | Statute |
|---|---|---|
| Homestead | **$250,000** equity (or $350,000 if owner is 60+, disabled, or homestead for an elderly / disabled family member) | C.R.S. § 38-41-201 |
| Motor vehicle | $7,500 ($12,500 if owner is 60+ or disabled) | C.R.S. § 13-54-102(1)(j) |
| Household goods | $7,500 | C.R.S. § 13-54-102(1)(e) |
| Wearing apparel | $3,000 | C.R.S. § 13-54-102(1)(a) |
| Watches and jewelry | $2,500 (pieces total) | C.R.S. § 13-54-102(1)(b) |
| Library, books, family pictures | $3,000 | C.R.S. § 13-54-102(1)(c) |
| Tools of trade | $30,000 | C.R.S. § 13-54-102(1)(i) |
| Public benefits (TANF, SSI, unemployment) | Fully exempt | C.R.S. § 13-54-102(1)(n) |
| Social Security | Fully exempt | C.R.S. § 13-54-102(1)(l); 42 U.S.C. § 407 |
| Earnings (after garnishment cap) | 75% disposable per week | C.R.S. § 13-54-104 |
| ERISA pension / 401(k) / IRA | Fully exempt | C.R.S. § 13-54-102(1)(s); 29 U.S.C. § 1056 |
| Health-savings account | Fully exempt | C.R.S. § 13-54-102(1)(u) |
| Personal-injury settlements | Variable | C.R.S. § 13-54-102(1)(n)(II) |

The exemption amounts above reflect the 2022 SB22-086 expansion
("Increasing Protections for Colorado Consumers"); they are
adjusted periodically for inflation.

**Claim of Exemption** procedure (C.R.S. § 13-54.5-108):

1. Within 14 days of garnishment notice, file written **Claim of
   Exemption** (JDF 84) with the issuing court
2. Court holds a hearing within 14 days
3. Garnishee must hold the funds pending the hearing

### Supplemental proceedings — C.R.C.P. 69

- **Debtor's exam**: judgment creditor may compel the debtor to
  appear and answer questions about assets (C.R.C.P. 69)
- **Order to appear**: use JDF 90 (Citation to Appear) — debtor must
  appear at the time and place stated
- **Failure to appear**: contempt; bench warrant possible
- **Document subpoena**: creditor may subpoena bank records and other
  documents

### Satisfaction of judgment — C.R.S. § 13-52-110

When the judgment is paid in full, the creditor must file a
**Satisfaction of Judgment** with the court within **21 days** of
the debtor's written demand. Failure to do so timely subjects the
creditor to a $100 statutory penalty plus actual damages plus
attorneys' fees.

If the creditor refuses, the debtor may file a **Motion for Entry
of Satisfaction** with proof of payment.

### Judgment revival — C.R.S. § 13-52-102

A Colorado judgment is good for **6 years** and may be revived by
**Scire Facias** filed before expiration. After revival, the
judgment is enforceable for another 6 years. After 20 years from
the original entry, the judgment is conclusively presumed paid.

## Common pro se post-judgment scenarios

1. **Default judgment in a debt-buyer case** — file C.R.C.P. 60(b)(1)
   motion to set aside within 182 days, asserting lack of service or
   excusable neglect plus a meritorious defense (chain of title, SOL,
   licensure under CFDCPA, etc.). See `co-consumer-debt`.
2. **Garnishment of bank account containing Social Security** —
   file Claim of Exemption (JDF 84) within 14 days; the SSA funds are
   fully exempt under 42 U.S.C. § 407.
3. **Wage garnishment when debtor is sole earner with dependents** —
   the 25% cap or 30-times-minimum-wage floor applies; if debtor
   qualifies, the **head-of-household** exemption may also apply
   under C.R.S. § 13-54-104.
4. **Old judgment** — check the 6-year revival clock; if not revived
   timely, the judgment is unenforceable.
