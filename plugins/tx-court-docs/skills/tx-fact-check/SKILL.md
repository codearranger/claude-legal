# Fact-Check Texas Court Filings

Use this skill before any Texas court filing leaves the desk. It runs
four passes. It is the deeper evidentiary-citation pass;
`tx-quality-check` is the lighter format-and-content pass. This skill
points at the canonical corpora rather than embedding statute text or
section numbers — pull current text from `tx-law-references`.

## Pass 1 — Citation verification

For every rule, statute, and case citation, verify:

- **Rule cited**: exists in the correct Texas rule set and says what
  the brief claims. Confirm the subdivision against current text via
  `tx-law-references`. Texas uses Rule-number plus lettered / numbered
  subparts (e.g., TRCP 166a(i), TRCP 197.2, TRCP 93(10)). The civil
  rules are the **Texas Rules of Civil Procedure (Tex. R. Civ. P. /
  TRCP)**; evidence is the **Texas Rules of Evidence (Tex. R. Evid.)**;
  appellate rules are the **Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure (Tex. R.
  App. P.)**.
- **Statute cited**: exists at the cited section, in the correct
  **code**. Texas statutes are organized into named codes — confirm the
  cite names the right one and the section exists:
  - **Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code** (e.g., § 16.004 limitations,
    § 31.002 turnover, § 132.001 unsworn declaration, § 34.001 dormancy)
  - **Tex. Fin. Code** (e.g., Ch. 392 Texas Debt Collection Act)
  - **Tex. Bus. & Com. Code** (e.g., Ch. 17 DTPA; the Texas UCC)
  - **Tex. Prop. Code** (e.g., Ch. 41 homestead, Ch. 42 personal
    property)
  - **Tex. Gov't Code** (e.g., § 662.003 holidays; court-organization
    chapters)
  - **Tex. Family Code** (e.g., Ch. 6 divorce, Ch. 153 conservatorship,
    Ch. 154 child support)
  Confirm against `tx-law-references`; flag any section the brief
  invented, mis-numbered, or placed in the wrong code. Confirm
  limitations periods against current text rather than memory.
- **Federal statute cited**: exists at the cited subsection (e.g.,
  FDCPA at 15 U.S.C. § 1692 et seq.). Pull from the federal corpus.
- **Case cited**: exists; the reporter citation is correct; the
  proposition stands for what the brief claims; the case has not been
  overruled or its petition history mis-stated. Use the connected
  **CourtListener** / case-law tools to confirm the case is real and
  read the holding (Supreme Court of Texas, the Courts of Appeals, and
  the Court of Criminal Appeals).

### Texas citation-format checks

Texas abolished its official Texas Reports; cite the **South Western
Reporter** in **Texas Rules of Form ("Greenbook")** style. Verify each
against current usage via `tx-law-references`:

- **Supreme Court of Texas**: `[Party A] v. [Party B], [###] S.W.[2d/3d]
  [###] (Tex. [YEAR])` — e.g., *In re Columbia Med. Ctr.*, 290 S.W.3d
  204 (Tex. 2009). Keep the periods in `S.W.2d`, `S.W.3d`, `Tex.`, and
  `v.`
- **★ Court of Appeals**: must include **both the district and the
  petition-history parenthetical** —
  `[Party A] v. [Party B], [###] S.W.3d [###] (Tex. App.—[District]
  [YEAR], [pet. history])` — e.g., *Doe v. Roe*, 123 S.W.3d 456 (Tex.
  App.—Dallas 2003, pet. denied). The **"pet. denied / pet. ref'd /
  pet. dism'd / no pet."** (or, for older cases, "writ ref'd / writ
  ref'd n.r.e. / no writ") subsequent-history parenthetical is a Texas
  signature. Flag a Court of Appeals cite **missing the district**
  (the em-dash "Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]" form) or **missing the
  petition-history parenthetical** as a format WARN. Confirm the
  district matches the deciding court.
- **Court of Criminal Appeals**: `(Tex. Crim. App. [YEAR])` — verify a
  criminal cite is not mis-attributed to the Supreme Court of Texas
  (Texas has **two courts of last resort**).
- **Statutes**: `Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 16.004`; `Tex. Fam. Code
  § 154.125`; `Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 17.50` (keep the `§`).
  **Rules**: `Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a`; `Tex. R. Evid. 803(6)`.
- Flag a missing `§` on statutes, dropped periods in reporter
  abbreviations, a wrong reporter series, a Court of Appeals cite with
  no district or no petition-history parenthetical, or a criminal cite
  attributed to the wrong high court as a format WARN.

## Pass 2 — Internal consistency

Within a single document, verify:

- **Party names**: each party named consistently throughout (and in
  `v.` form in any case caption); party **designations** match the
  forum (**Plaintiff/Defendant** in general civil; **Petitioner/
  Respondent** in family law).
- **Cause number**: appears identically wherever it recurs, and matches
  the court named in the caption (District Court / County Court at Law /
  Justice Court, and the correct county).
- **Dates**: every date is consistent across all appearances (date of
  service, date of contract, date of last payment, date judgment was
  signed). A deadline that runs from a stated date must be supported by
  that date.
- **Dollar amounts**: every amount is consistent and the totals add up
  (principal + interest + fees + costs = total demanded), and the
  pleaded **TRCP 47(c) relief range** is consistent with the amount
  demanded.
- **Defined terms**: any term defined with `(the "Account")` is used
  consistently (no slipping into "the loan" or "the debt").
- **Cross-references**: every "see paragraph X" or "see Exhibit Y"
  resolves to a real location.
- **Numbered paragraphs**: sequential without gaps or duplicates.

## Pass 3 — Packet consistency

Across the multi-document packet (motion + supporting affidavit /
unsworn declaration + Notice of Hearing or Submission + proposed order
+ certificate of service):

- **Caption identical** in every document: court, county, party names,
  and cause number must match exactly.
- **Document title** matches between the motion, its certificate of
  service, the Notice of Hearing / Submission, and the proposed order's
  title.
- **Dates align**: the certificate-of-service date should match the
  signature date on the motion; an affidavit's jurat date or an unsworn
  declaration's execution date should align with when it was made; the
  hearing / submission date respects the applicable lead time (the
  local notice clock, or the **TRCP 166a 21-day** summary-judgment lead
  with the response due 7 days before).
- **Relief sought matches**: the motion's prayer must mirror the
  proposed order's decretal language item by item.
- **Exhibits** referenced in the motion are described in the affidavit /
  declaration and physically attached.
- **Signature / bar number**: each signed document carries the signer's
  signature and, for an attorney, the **State Bar of Texas bar
  number**; a self-represented filer signs without one (TRCP 57).

## Pass 4 — Sworn vs. argued

Compare what is sworn-to in the supporting affidavit / unsworn
declaration against what is argued in the motion or response:

- Every **factual assertion** in the argument should be (a) supported
  by a citation to a paragraph of the affidavit / declaration, (b)
  admitted in the pleadings, or (c) a matter of judicial notice.
- Identify any factual claim in the brief **not** supported by the
  affidavit / declaration — a gap to fix before filing.
- Identify any sworn fact **not used** in the brief — consider whether
  it belongs in the affidavit at all.
- Verify the affidavit / declaration's **personal-knowledge
  foundation** and, for a business-records affidavit, that it satisfies
  the custodian / qualified-witness requirement of **Tex. R. Evid.
  803(6)** and the self-authentication mechanics of **Tex. R. Evid.
  902(10)** (the affidavit form and pre-trial notice/filing — verify
  the exact 902(10) sub-paragraph numbering against current text). In a
  debt case, scrutinize whether the affiant shows knowledge of the
  **original creditor's** records. Flag paragraphs that begin "I
  believe" or "I understand" without a foundation.
- **Sworn-account / verified-denial check.** If the petition pleads a
  **sworn account (TRCP 185)**, confirm the verification is proper; if
  the answer contests it, confirm the **verified denial (TRCP 93(10) /
  185)** is present and sworn (or carries a CPRC § 132.001 declaration).
- Confirm an **unsworn declaration** carries the **Tex. Civ. Prac. &
  Rem. Code § 132.001** subscription "under penalty of perjury,"
  including the declarant's **date of birth and address** and a date, or
  the affidavit carries a completed jurat.

## Output format

When invoked on a packet, produce a structured verification report:

  WARN  Pleaded relief range (Rule 47(c)) does not match the amount
        demanded in the prayer

Pass 3 (Packet consistency)

        of the TRCP 166a 21-day lead

Pass 4 (Sworn vs. argued)
  FAIL  Motion p.3 asserts "the affiant reviewed the original
        creditor's records"; declaration shows no such foundation
  WARN  Answer contests a TRCP 185 sworn account but the verified
        denial is not sworn (no jurat / no § 132.001 declaration)

Summary: 5 PASS / 4 WARN / 3 FAIL — DO NOT FILE until FAILs resolved.
