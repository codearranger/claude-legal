# Texas — First 30 Days After Service

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Time is short. This skill helps a defendant
> sketch a response and surface the most important deadlines, but
> consult a licensed Texas attorney about substantive defenses when
> possible.

Use this skill when the defendant has **just been served** with a
**citation and petition** in a District Court, County Court at Law, or
Justice Court. It frames the response window: the time in which the
defendant must file an answer or risk a **default judgment**. Pull
verbatim rule text from `../tx-law-references/references/court-rules/`,
and compute the actual due date with `tx-deadlines`.

## ★ The clock — the Texas "Monday rule" — TRCP 99

> **★ The answer is NOT due a flat number of days after service.** In
> District Court and County Court at Law, the citation commands the
> defendant to file a written answer **"by 10:00 a.m. on the Monday
> next after the expiration of twenty days after the date of service"**
> (**TRCP 99**). Count 20 days from the date of service; then the answer
> is due at **10:00 a.m. on the next Monday** after that. This is the
> Texas **"Monday rule"** — flag it prominently and never treat the
> deadline as a flat 20-day count. Compute the exact date with
> `tx-deadlines` (`--rule answer-due`).

> **★ Justice Court is different — 14 days.** In Justice Court (small
> claims / debt claim / eviction, TRCP 500–510), the defendant's answer
> is due by the **end of the 14th day** after the date the defendant
> was served with citation (**TRCP 502.5**); eviction has its own
> compressed schedule under TRCP 510. Confirm the operative count
> against the corpus and `tx-deadlines`.

> ⚠ **Default risk.** If the defendant does not file an answer by the
> deadline, the plaintiff may take a **default judgment** (TRCP 239).
> Setting one aside later requires meeting the **Craddock** standard
> (below) — much harder than answering on time. **Filing any timely
> answer — even a bare general denial — cuts off a no-answer default.**

## Playbook

### Days 0–3 — read the petition, check the citation

- **Read every numbered paragraph.** Note who is suing, on what claims,
  for what relief, and what contracts / accounts / events are alleged.
  Check whether the petition pleads a **sworn account** (TRCP 185) — if
  so, a **verified denial is mandatory** (below).
- **Note the court, county, and cause number** — these go on every
  filing (`tx-statewide-format` caption).
- **Confirm the tier.** Justice Court (debt-claim / small claims /
  eviction) answers run on the 14-day TRCP 502.5 clock; District Court
  and County Court at Law answers run on the Monday rule (TRCP 99).
- **Check service** and the citation. Defective service, lack of
  personal jurisdiction, and improper venue are challengeable — preserve
  them (below). A defendant served by substituted service (TRCP 106) or
  citation by publication has special posture.

### Days 3–10 — choose the response strategy

The principal paths, which can be combined:

1. **Original Answer** — typically a **general denial** under **TRCP 92**
   (one sentence putting the plaintiff to its proof on all but the
   matters that must be specifically or verifiably denied), plus any
   **verified denials (TRCP 93)**, **affirmative defenses**, and
   **counterclaims**.
2. **Special exceptions** under **TRCP 91** — the Texas vehicle to
   challenge a vague, defective, or insufficient pleading (Texas has
   **no general demurrer**). The remedy is an opportunity to replead,
   not dismissal.
3. **Rule 91a motion to dismiss** — to dismiss a cause of action with
   **no basis in law or fact** (below).
4. **Special appearance (TRCP 120a)** — to contest personal
   jurisdiction; it must be filed **before** any other plea (a general
   appearance waives the jurisdiction challenge), and follows the "due
   order of pleadings."

### ★ Verified denials — TRCP 93 (and the sworn-account denial)

> ⚠ **Some defenses must be denied under oath.** **TRCP 93** lists
> matters that must be denied by a **verified pleading** (a sworn
> denial / affidavit or an unsworn declaration under CPRC § 132.001) —
> a general denial alone is **not enough** to put them in issue. The
> list includes (verify the current text against the corpus): lack of
> legal capacity to sue or be sued, defect of parties, that a written
> instrument's execution is denied, want or failure of consideration,
> and — critically in collection suits — **denial of a sworn account
> under TRCP 93(10) / TRCP 185.**

> **★ Sworn account (TRCP 185).** If the plaintiff pleads its claim as
> a verified "suit on a sworn account," that verified account is
> **prima facie evidence** of the debt **unless** the defendant files a
> **written denial under oath** (TRCP 185, in the manner TRCP 93(10)
> requires). Failing to file the sworn denial can mean the plaintiff
> proves its case on the pleadings alone. **A defendant contesting a
> sworn-account suit must file the verified denial** — see
> `tx-consumer-debt`.

### Rule 91a — motion to dismiss a baseless cause of action

> **TRCP 91a** allows a party to move to dismiss a cause of action that
> has **no basis in law or in fact** — the Texas analog to a federal
> 12(b)(6) motion (added 2013). It must be filed **within 60 days after
> the first pleading containing the challenged cause of action** is
> served, and at least 21 days before the hearing. Fee-shifting under
> Rule 91a was **made discretionary by 2019 legislation** — confirm the
> current cost/fee rule against the corpus before relying on it.

### Days 10–30 — draft the answer (or the motion)

#### Answer structure (TRCP 92 / 93)

```
                    DEFENDANT'S ORIGINAL ANSWER

   Defendant [Name] files this Original Answer to Plaintiff's
   [Original Petition] and would respectfully show:

                       I. GENERAL DENIAL
   Pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 92, Defendant generally denies each and
   every allegation in Plaintiff's petition and demands strict proof
   thereof by a preponderance of the evidence.

                  II. VERIFIED DENIAL (if applicable)
   Pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 93 [and 185], Defendant specifically
   denies under oath that [there is a sworn account / the account is
   just and true / Defendant executed the instrument / there was
   consideration]. [Attach affidavit or CPRC § 132.001 declaration.]

                    III. AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES
   [Plead each affirmative defense — TRCP 94 — that may apply.]

                       IV. COUNTERCLAIM (if any)
   [Plead complaint-style with numbered allegations and named counts.]
```

#### Affirmative-defense catalog — TRCP 94

Plead **all** that may apply (TRCP 94 requires affirmative defenses to
be **pleaded** or they may be waived). Common Texas defenses:

- Statute of limitations (very common — verify the period against
  `tx-deadlines` / the subject bundle: 4-year debt/contract under CPRC
  § 16.004; 2-year tort/PI under § 16.003)
- Payment / accord and satisfaction / release
- Discharge in bankruptcy
- Statute of frauds
- Estoppel / waiver / laches
- Failure of consideration / fraud / illegality
- Res judicata / collateral estoppel (prior judgment)
- Lack of standing / chain of title (debt-buyer cases — see
  `tx-consumer-debt`)
- Limitation of liability / proportionate responsibility (CPRC Ch. 33)

### Counterclaims — compulsory vs. permissive — TRCP 97

- **Compulsory counterclaim (TRCP 97(a)).** A pleader **must** state any
  claim against the opposing party that arises out of the **transaction
  or occurrence** that is the subject of the opposing party's claim and
  does not require third parties over whom the court lacks jurisdiction.
  A compulsory counterclaim not pleaded can be **barred** later. Plead
  all known related counterclaims with the answer.
- **Permissive counterclaim (TRCP 97(b))** — any other claim against an
  opposing party. **Cross-claims** against co-parties run under TRCP
  97(e). Note **CPRC § 16.069** allows a counterclaim arising from the
  same transaction to be filed even if limitations would otherwise have
  run, within a short window after the original claim — confirm against
  the corpus.

### Removal to federal court — caution

> If the suit could have been brought in federal court (a federal claim
> or complete diversity above the amount-in-controversy threshold), a
> defendant generally has **30 days from service** to remove under 28
> U.S.C. § 1446. Removal is a **federal procedural step** with its own
> strict clock that can run separately from the state answer deadline —
> evaluate it early, and do not let the state answer lapse while
> considering removal.

### Setting aside a default — the Craddock standard

If a default judgment is already entered, a defendant may move for new
trial to set it aside. Texas applies the **Craddock v. Sunshine Bus
Lines** standard (*Craddock v. Sunshine Bus Lines, Inc.*, 134 S.W.2d
124 (Tex. 1939)): the movant must show that (1) the failure to answer
was **not intentional or the result of conscious indifference** but due
to accident or mistake; (2) the motion sets up a **meritorious
defense**; and (3) granting it will **not cause delay or injury** to
the plaintiff. The motion for new trial is itself deadline-bound
(within 30 days of the judgment) — see `tx-post-judgment` and
`tx-deadlines`.

## Filing the answer / motion

- **File** with the clerk in the caption — district clerk (District
  Court), county clerk (County Court at Law), or the JP's clerk
  (Justice Court). E-file through **eFileTexas.gov** (mandatory for
  attorneys; available to self-represented filers).
- **Serve** all parties under **TRCP 21 / 21a** with a certificate of
  service (the answer does not require formal citation service).
- **Sign** under **TRCP 57** (party signature) and TRCP 13 (the
  signature is a certification; sanctions attach).

## Composition

- Format / caption / verification: `tx-statewide-format`
- Drafting + the summary-judgment standard (traditional 166a(c) /
  no-evidence 166a(i)): `tx-draft-motion`, `tx-draft-declaration`
- Filing court: `tx-hcdc`, `tx-dcdc`, `tx-county-courts`
- Deadline arithmetic (the Monday rule, the 14-day JP answer):
  `tx-deadlines`; default vacatur / Craddock: `tx-post-judgment`
- Matter-specific defenses: `tx-consumer-debt`, `tx-family-law`
- Noticing any motion for hearing or submission: `tx-schedule-hearing`,
  `tx-hearings`
- Pro se signature conventions: `tx-pro-se`
