# Assemble a Texas Court Filing Packet

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** This skill walks through filing mechanics.
> Verify the e-filing platform, document types, fees, redaction rule,
> and self-represented acceptance with the filing court's clerk before
> submitting.

Use this skill when ready to **submit** a Texas trial-court filing.
First determine the **filing channel**, then assemble and preflight
the multi-document packet.

## Texas e-filing — eFileTexas (Odyssey File & Serve)

Texas's statewide e-filing system is **eFileTexas.gov**, built on
**Tyler Technologies' Odyssey File & Serve**, under **Tex. R. Civ. P.
21(f)** and the Supreme Court of Texas's e-filing rules (and the Tex.
R. Jud. Admin. technology standards):

- **Mandatory for attorneys** in civil cases in all courts (district,
  county, and justice courts).
- **Permitted for self-represented filers** — a self-represented
  party **may** e-file through eFileTexas (and many courts encourage
  or require it); filers may also file on paper at the clerk's window
  where the court accepts it. Confirm the court's acceptance of
  self-represented paper filings.
- **E-filing = consent to e-service.** Those who e-file are served
  subsequent documents electronically through the system under
  Tex. R. Civ. P. 21a.
- **E-format.** Documents are submitted as **text-searchable PDFs**,
  within the system's size caps; the **civil case information sheet**
  and any proposed order are typically uploaded as separate lead/
  attachment documents per the court's filing-code menu.
- **TexasLawHelp.org** offers guided self-help forms and the assisted
  filing front end for self-represented filers.

Confirm the court is live on eFileTexas for the case type and whether
the **court level** (district / county / justice) affects the filing
path before assuming the channel.

## E-filing workflow (eFileTexas / Odyssey File & Serve)

The portal shape is consistent across courts:

1. Register / log in to an eFileTexas (Odyssey File & Serve) account
2. Search for the case by cause number or party name (or start a new
   case for an initial filing)
3. Select the court, case category, and the **filing code / document
   type** for each component
4. Upload each component as a **separate text-searchable PDF** (mind
   the size caps); attach the **civil case information sheet** and the
   **proposed order** under the appropriate filing codes
5. Pay any filing fee, or attach the **Statement of Inability to
   Afford Payment of Court Costs**
6. Submit; the system returns a filing confirmation / file-stamp and
   effects electronic service on registered parties

## Paper filing (self-represented; courts/case types not on eFileTexas)

A self-represented filer may file on **paper** where the court accepts
it. Bring clean copies to the clerk's window during business hours;
the clerk file-stamps the original and returns a stamped copy. Confirm
whether the court accepts mail or drop-box filings and how many copies
(judge's copy / conformed copy) the court wants.

## Multi-document packet — typical components

A standard Texas filing packet consists of these documents:

| # | Document | Authority / note |
|---|----------|------|
| 1 | Original Petition **or** Motion | Tex. R. Civ. P. 45 / 47 (petition) or Rule 21 (motion); plain statement, numbered paragraphs |
| 2 | **Tex. R. Civ. P. 47(c) statement of relief range** | Pleaded **within** the petition; its omission can bar a default judgment |
| 3 | Civil Case Information Sheet | **Tex. R. Civ. P. 78a** — filed with an initial pleading; use the Supreme Court of Texas form |
| 4 | Notice of Hearing / Notice of Submission | Tex. R. Civ. P. 21 — sets the motion for oral hearing or submission; respect the notice floor (21 days for Rule 166a) |
| 5 | Affidavit or unsworn declaration | Notarized affidavit or CPRC § 132.001 unsworn declaration; Tex. R. Evid. 902(10) records foundation |
| 6 | Exhibits | Attach written instruments referenced in the pleading/motion |
| 7 | Proposed order | Tendered for the judge's signature; see `tx-submit-order` |
| 8 | Certificate of Service | Tex. R. Civ. P. 21a — date, manner, recipients |

Choose the closest matching filing-code label in the eFileTexas menu;
the menus vary by court and case category.

> **Tex. R. Civ. P. 47(c) and 78a are Texas-specific.** Every initial
> petition must plead the **range-of-relief statement** (Rule 47(c))
> and be accompanied by the **civil case information sheet** (Rule
> 78a). Do not file an initial petition without both.

## Sensitive / personal information — redaction

Texas **restricts sensitive data** in court filings. Before filing,
review every component (including exhibits) and handle protected data
as the governing rule requires — generally by **omitting or
truncating** identifiers such as Social Security, driver's-license,
passport, financial-account, and similar numbers, and using any
required sensitive-data mechanism where the data must reach the court
but be kept out of the public file.

> Verify the exact rule and procedure against `tx-law-references` —
> confirm the precise list of protected identifiers, the
> partial-redaction format, and whether a separate sealed/restricted
> filing is required. The filing court may have additional local
> requirements.

The filing party is responsible for the redaction; the clerk does
not redact for you.

## Cross-document consistency

Before assembling, confirm the packet is internally consistent:

- **Same caption** across every document — court, county, party names,
  cause number, document titles
- **Relief sought matches** between the motion's PRAYER and the
  proposed order, item by item
- The **document title named in the certificate of service** matches
  the document actually filed
- **Dates align** — certificate-of-service date matches the signature
  date; the affidavit jurat / § 132.001 declaration date is
  consistent; the hearing/submission date respects the notice floor
- **All referenced exhibits** are attached

Run `tx-quality-check` for the full pre-filing pass.

## Preflight — run the helper scripts

Before assembling the packet:

```
# Format / caption + form check
python3 plugins/tx-court-docs/scripts/format-check.py path/to/filing.docx

# Deadline arithmetic — TRCP 4 time computation, +3-day mail add-on
# (TRCP 21a), with Texas court-holiday handling (Gov't Code § 662.003)
python3 plugins/tx-court-docs/scripts/case-calendar.py ...
```

Use `case-calendar.py` to confirm the Notice-of-Hearing lead time
(the Rule 21(b) floor, or **21 days** for a Rule 166a motion) and to
compute response deadlines with the applicable mail add-on.

## Filing fees

Filing fees are set by statute and the clerk's fee schedule and vary
by court and case type. **Confirm the current amount with the filing
court's clerk** before submitting; do not hard-code a figure. Pay by
the portal's accepted method (card / e-check) or at the clerk's
cashier window for paper filings.

### Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs

A filer who cannot afford the fees may file a **Statement of Inability
to Afford Payment of Court Costs** (the Texas indigency mechanism
under **Tex. R. Civ. P. 145**) **in lieu of** paying. File the
statement with the first filing rather than paying and seeking a
refund. The clerk must accept the filing without a fee; a party may
contest the statement under the rule's procedure. Verify the current
form and procedure with the clerk. See `tx-pro-se`.

## Filing vs. service — two distinct steps

Filing with the court is **not** the same as serving the opposing
party:

1. **Filing** — through eFileTexas, or at the clerk's window.
2. **Service of process** (initial citation + petition) — under
   **Tex. R. Civ. P. 99 et seq.** (issuance and service of citation;
   the answer is then due by the **Rule 99 "Monday rule"** deadline in
   district/county court, or by the **end of the 14th day** after
   service in justice court under Rule 502.5). Verify the current
   service mechanics.
3. **Service of subsequent papers** (motions, Notice of Hearing,
   orders) — under **Tex. R. Civ. P. 21a**, on every party by an
   allowed method, documented in the **Certificate of Service**. Add
   **+3 days** for service by mail / commercial delivery / fax / email
   when computing a deadline that runs from service.

If the system performs electronic service on registered parties, a
party without an e-filing account must still be served by another
allowed Rule 21a method — confirm the portal's e-service coverage for
each party.
