# Texas Post-Judgment Procedure

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** This skill addresses procedure once a Texas
> judgment has been entered. Verify every step — and every dollar
> figure, acreage, and day count — against current law before filing
> or responding.

Use this skill alongside `tx-statewide-format` when the case is **past
judgment** — whether you are attacking the judgment, defending against
collection, or collecting on it. Pull verbatim rule and statute text
from `../tx-law-references/references/`.

## Two paths after judgment

1. **Attack the judgment** — a motion for new trial or to modify,
   correct, or reform (TRCP 320–329b), a restricted appeal or bill of
   review (after plenary power lapses), or setting aside a default under
   the **Craddock** standard.
2. **Collect or resist collection** — abstract of judgment and judgment
   lien, **turnover order (CPRC § 31.002)**, writ of execution, and the
   exemptions (Prop. Code Ch. 41 / Ch. 42) that protect the debtor.

## Attacking the judgment

### Motion for new trial / to modify, correct, or reform — TRCP 320–329b

- **Motion for new trial — TRCP 320, 324.** Grounds include newly
  discovered evidence, a verdict against the great weight of the
  evidence, jury misconduct, and error. A motion for new trial is a
  prerequisite to complaining of certain matters on appeal (TRCP 324).
- **Motion to modify, correct, or reform the judgment — TRCP 329b(g).**
  Asks the trial court to change the judgment itself.

> ⚠ **Timing — 30 days from signing.** A motion for new trial or to
> modify, correct, or reform must be filed **within 30 days after the
> judgment is signed** (**TRCP 329b(a), (g)**). Calendar it the moment
> the judgment is signed — see `tx-deadlines`.

> **★ Plenary power — TRCP 329b(d).** The trial court keeps **plenary
> power** to vacate, modify, correct, or reform its judgment for **30
> days after signing**. A **timely** motion for new trial or to modify
> **extends** plenary power (up to the limits in TRCP 329b(e)–(g)). Once
> plenary power expires, the trial court generally **loses authority**
> to change the judgment — the remaining routes are appeal, restricted
> appeal, or a bill of review. Track this clock carefully.

### Setting aside a default — the Craddock standard

A defendant hit with a **no-answer or post-answer default** may move for
new trial to set it aside under **Craddock v. Sunshine Bus Lines, Inc.**,
134 S.W.2d 124 (Tex. 1939): the movant must show (1) the failure to
answer / appear was **not intentional or the result of conscious
indifference** but accident or mistake; (2) a **meritorious defense**;
and (3) that a new trial will **not cause delay or injury** to the
plaintiff. The motion is bound by the **30-day** TRCP 329b clock — file
within plenary power. Pair with the substantive defense (chain of
title, statute of limitations) — see `tx-consumer-debt` and
`tx-first-30-days`.

### After plenary power — restricted appeal and bill of review

- **Restricted appeal (Tex. R. App. P. 30).** Available to a party who
  did **not participate** in the hearing that led to the judgment and
  did not timely file a post-judgment motion or appeal — filed within
  **6 months** of the judgment, requiring error apparent on the face of
  the record. Confirm the current window and requirements against the
  corpus.
- **Bill of review.** An independent equitable suit to set aside a
  judgment no longer appealable, requiring a meritorious defense
  prevented by fraud, accident, or wrongful act unmixed with the
  movant's own negligence. A demanding remedy — confirm the elements
  and limitations period against current law.

### Findings of fact and conclusions of law — TRCP 296–299

After a bench trial, a party may **request findings of fact and
conclusions of law** under TRCP 296 within the rule's window; they
sharpen the record for appeal. Confirm the request and reminder
intervals in the corpus.

## Collecting / resisting collection

### Abstract of judgment and judgment liens

Recording an **abstract of judgment** with the county clerk creates a
**judgment lien on the debtor's non-exempt real property** in that
county (Tex. Prop. Code Ch. 52). **The lien does not attach to exempt
homestead property.** Confirm the abstract contents, recording
mechanics, and lien duration / renewal against the corpus.

### Writ of execution

A **writ of execution** (TRCP 621 et seq.) directs the constable or
sheriff to levy on and sell the debtor's **non-exempt** property to
satisfy the judgment. Execution may issue while the judgment remains
enforceable (not dormant — below).

### ★ Turnover proceeding — CPRC § 31.002

> **The turnover statute is the workhorse Texas post-judgment remedy.**
> Under **Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 31.002**, a judgment creditor
> may obtain a **turnover order** reaching non-exempt property that
> cannot readily be attached or levied on by ordinary process (e.g.,
> accounts receivable, business interests, rights to payment). The
> court may order the debtor to turn over property, appoint a receiver,
> and enjoin transfers. **A turnover order may not reach exempt
> property.** A debtor served with a turnover motion should assert
> applicable exemptions promptly. Confirm the current text and any fee
> provision against the corpus.

### ★ Wage garnishment is generally prohibited for consumer debt

> **★ A signature Texas debtor protection.** The Texas Constitution,
> **art. XVI, § 28**, prohibits garnishment of **current wages for
> personal service** except for court-ordered child support and spousal
> maintenance (and certain federal debts like taxes and student loans).
> **An ordinary consumer-debt or contract creditor generally CANNOT
> garnish a Texas debtor's wages.** This is a meaningful protection for
> a debtor.
>
> **But bank-account garnishment IS allowed.** Once wages are
> **deposited and are no longer "current wages,"** funds in a bank
> account can be reached by **garnishment** (TRCP 657–679; CPRC Ch. 63)
> or by a turnover order — subject to any exemption (e.g., federally
> protected Social Security under 42 U.S.C. § 407, certain retirement
> funds, and the Texas personal-property exemptions). Verify the
> current scope and procedure against the corpus.

### ★ Exemptions from execution — Prop. Code Ch. 41 and Ch. 42

A debtor protects property through Texas's **generous statutory
exemptions**:

- **Homestead — Tex. Prop. Code Ch. 41.** Texas's famously broad
  homestead exemption protects the homestead from forced sale for most
  debts **regardless of value** — it is **limited by acreage**, not by
  dollar value (urban vs. rural, single adult vs. family). **Do not
  rely on an acreage figure from memory** — look up the current
  urban/rural and single/family acreage caps in
  `../tx-law-references/references/` (Prop. Code §§ 41.001–41.002).
- **Personal property — Tex. Prop. Code Ch. 42.** Protects designated
  personal property up to an **aggregate fair-market-value cap** that
  differs for a **family** versus a **single adult**, plus categorically
  exempt items (certain home furnishings, tools of the trade, a motor
  vehicle, livestock, and prescribed benefits). **The aggregate cap
  drifts and is periodically adjusted — verify the current figures in
  the corpus** before asserting them.
- **Earnings** — current wages for personal service are exempt (art.
  XVI, § 28, above).
- **Categorically protected funds** — **Social Security** (42 U.S.C.
  § 407), certain public benefits, and qualified retirement accounts.

> ⚠ **Do not rely on an exemption dollar amount or acreage from
> memory.** The Ch. 41 acreage caps and the Ch. 42 aggregate cap are
> set and periodically adjusted by statute. **Look up the current
> figures in `../tx-law-references/references/` and verify** before
> asserting them.

To claim an exemption against a garnishment or levy, the debtor files a
written claim / response in the issuing court within the period the
garnishment or turnover papers specify; the court then resolves it.
Act promptly — see `tx-deadlines`.

### ★ Dormancy and revival of judgment — CPRC § 34.001

> **A Texas money judgment goes DORMANT if no writ of execution issues
> within the statutory period.** Under **Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code
> § 34.001**, a judgment becomes **dormant** (and execution may not
> issue on it) if a writ of execution is not issued within **10 years**
> after rendition (or within 10 years of the last writ). A dormant
> judgment may be **revived by scire facias or an action of debt**
> brought within the period set by **CPRC § 31.006** (confirm the
> current revival window against the corpus). A debtor facing
> collection on an **old** judgment should check whether the judgment
> went dormant and was never revived. See `tx-deadlines`.

### Post-judgment discovery / debtor's examination

To **locate assets**, the creditor may serve post-judgment discovery
(TRCP 621a) or seek the debtor's appearance to answer under oath about
income, property, and accounts; turnover proceedings (above) are
commonly paired with this. Failure to appear after proper service can
expose the debtor to **contempt**. Confirm the current procedure and
notice in the corpus.

### Satisfaction / release of judgment

When a judgment is paid in full, a **release of judgment** should be
filed and (where an abstract was recorded) recorded. If the creditor
refuses after payment, the debtor may move the court for an order; some
statutes impose a duty and penalty for failure to release after demand
— verify against the corpus.

## Common pro se scenarios

1. **Debt-buyer default judgment** — motion for new trial under the
   **Craddock** standard within the 30-day TRCP 329b window, plus a
   meritorious defense (chain of title, SOL). After plenary power,
   consider restricted appeal / bill of review. See `tx-consumer-debt`.
2. **Bank account holding wages or Social Security garnished** — assert
   that current wages are constitutionally exempt and that deposited
   Social Security is exempt under 42 U.S.C. § 407; file the exemption
   claim within the writ window.
3. **Creditor seeks a turnover order** — assert applicable Ch. 41 / Ch.
   42 exemptions; the order cannot reach exempt property.
4. **Old judgment surfaces** — check whether it went **dormant** (no
   writ within 10 years, CPRC § 34.001) and was never revived.
5. **Homestead threatened** — confirm the Ch. 41 acreage protection;
   the homestead is generally beyond forced sale for ordinary debts.
