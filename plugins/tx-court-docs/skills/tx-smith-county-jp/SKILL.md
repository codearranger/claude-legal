Use this skill when the matter is in a **Smith County Justice Court**
— the court of a **Justice of the Peace** sitting in a Smith County
**precinct**. Smith County's county seat is **Tyler**, and the county
sits in the **Seventh Administrative Judicial Region** of Texas. This
skill **layers on top of** `tx-justice-courts` (which carries the
statewide **TRCP Part V, Rules 500–510** framework) and
`tx-statewide-format`. Read those for the rules that control;
everything below is the Smith County overlay.

## The Smith County JP precincts

Smith County is divided into **Justice of the Peace precincts** —
commonly **Precinct 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5** — and some precincts have a
**Place 1 / Place 2** (each Place with its own elected Justice of the
Peace and clerk). **Confirm the current precinct/place layout and the
assigned Justice of the Peace with Smith County** before filing or
answering — the precinct count and the Place divisions change, and
**venue within the county** generally lies in the precinct where the
defendant resides or where the eviction premises is located (confirm
the applicable venue rule, TRCP 502.4 / 510.4, and the correct
precinct).

## What the Smith County Justice Courts hear

The Smith County JP courts hear the same matters as every Texas
Justice Court, under **TRCP Part V**:

- **Small-claims** money cases up to the statutory ceiling;
- **Debt-claim cases (TRCP 508)** — most consumer-debt collection
  suits in the county, including those by debt buyers and collectors;
- **Eviction (forcible entry and detainer) (TRCP 510)** — expedited,
  with the **5-day** appeal track;
- **Repair-and-remedy (TRCP 509)**.

The **monetary ceiling** is statutory and **drift-prone** — confirm
the current cap against **Tex. Gov't Code § 27.031** and **TRCP
500.3** via `tx-law-references` (and see `tx-justice-courts`). The
**TRCP 500.3(e)** quirk applies fully: the ordinary rules of civil
procedure and the rules of evidence do **not** apply in the Smith
County Justice Court except as Part V incorporates them.

## Answer deadline and default

The defendant's **answer is due by the end of the 14th day after
service of citation (TRCP 502.5)** — the simplified Justice Court
deadline, **not** the District-Court "Monday rule." File the answer
(a general denial suffices to put the plaintiff to its proof) before
the deadline to avoid a **default judgment under TRCP 503**. Confirm
the current 14-day figure against the corpus. See `tx-justice-courts`
and `tx-first-30-days`.

## Eviction practice in the precinct

Eviction suits in a Smith County precinct run on the compressed
**TRCP 510** timeline — a quick trial setting after service (the
landlord must first have given the **Tex. Prop. Code Ch. 24** notice
to vacate), and a **5-day** appeal window to the county court, with
the rule's **pay-rent-into-the-registry** conditions for a tenant who
appeals to stay in possession. **Confirm the current 5-day deadline
and pay-rent conditions against TRCP 510** — missing them forfeits
the appeal and possession. See `tx-justice-courts`, `tx-deadlines`,
and `tx-post-judgment`.

## Debt-claim practice in the precinct

Smith County JP debt-claim cases (TRCP 508) are the everyday forum
for consumer-debt collection in the county. The simplified procedure
means a plaintiff may try to prove up the account without
higher-court evidentiary formalities — scrutinize the plaintiff's
proof, the **chain of title** from the original creditor through each
assignee, the **four-year limitations** posture, and the **Texas Debt
Collection Act / DTPA** overlay. The substantive defenses live in
`tx-consumer-debt`; the JP-court mechanics live in
`tx-justice-courts`.

## Filing — eFileTexas plus the precinct clerk

Smith County e-files through **eFileTexas.gov** (Odyssey File &
Serve). A self-represented filer may e-file or file with the **precinct
clerk** in person — confirm the precinct's accepted methods, the
filing fee, and the **Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of
Court Costs** option with the specific precinct. The assisted
self-help front end is **TexasLawHelp.org**, which hosts the JP-court
forms (answer, Statement of Inability, eviction answer, appeal).

## De novo appeal to a Smith County Court at Law

A party who loses in a Smith County Justice Court may appeal **de
novo** — a brand-new trial — to a **Smith County Court at Law** (the
county court that hears JP appeals under the county's structure;
confirm which county court takes the appeal). The appellant perfects
the appeal under **TRCP 506** (ordinary civil) or **TRCP 510**
(eviction, the **5-day** track) by filing an appeal bond, a cash
deposit, or a Statement of Inability to Afford Payment within the
deadline. The destination court and its procedure live in
`tx-county-courts`.

## Smith County's higher-tier courts belong to other skills

This skill covers **only** the Smith County **Justice (JP) Courts**.
Smith County's higher-tier matters are handled elsewhere:

- Smith County's **District Courts** — the **7th, 114th, 241st,
  321st (family), and 475th** Judicial District Courts (confirm the
  current list with the district clerk) — and its **County Courts at
  Law** are covered by **`tx-county-courts`** for general civil
  matters.
- Smith County **family matters** (divorce, SAPCR — often heard in
  the **321st** family district court) are covered by
  **`tx-family-court`** and **`tx-family-law`**.

Route a matter above the JP ceiling, a title-to-land dispute, a
divorce/SAPCR, or any matter outside Part V to those skills.

## Caption — Smith County Justice Court variant

```
                          CAUSE NO. ____________

[PLAINTIFF],                       §   IN THE JUSTICE COURT
                                   §
       Plaintiff,                  §   PRECINCT [N], PLACE [N]
v.                                 §
                                   §
[DEFENDANT],                       §
       Defendant.                  §   SMITH COUNTY, TEXAS
```

See `tx-statewide-format` for the full caption with the **§**
divider, the line-numbered pleading paper, the footer, and the
signature block (a self-represented filer omits the State Bar of
Texas number and signs pro se). **Confirm the precinct/place
designation with the Smith County precinct clerk.**

**Agent behavior:** before drafting an answer, calendaring a
deadline, or assembling an appeal, verify with the specific Smith
County JP precinct (1) the **current precinct/place layout and the
assigned Justice of the Peace**, (2) the **answer deadline (TRCP
502.5)** or, for eviction, the **TRCP 510** setting and **5-day**
appeal deadline, (3) the current **jurisdictional ceiling** from the
corpus, and (4) the eFileTexas / precinct-clerk filing posture. Treat
**TRCP Part V** as the controlling rule set (TRCP 500.3(e)).
