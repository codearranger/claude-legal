## Assignment system: IAS (Individual Assignment System)

New York's **Individual Assignment System** (22 NYCRR § 202.3)
routes every case to a single IAS Justice at commencement.
That Justice owns the case through judgment. Practical
consequences:

- The Notice of Motion is **returnable before the assigned
  Justice's Part**, not before a generic motion calendar
- Each Justice publishes their own **Part Rules** ("Rules of
  Practice for Part [##]") — page limits, deadlines for
  pre-motion conferences, courtesy-copy requirements, oral-
  argument practice. **These supersede the uniform rules.**
- Find the Justice's Part Rules at
  https://ww2.nycourts.gov/courts/1jd/supctmanh/Part%20Rules.shtml
  (the "1jd" path is the 1st Judicial District index)

## Commercial Division (22 NYCRR § 202.70)

The Commercial Division is a separate division within Supreme
Court, NY County, for commercial disputes meeting two tests:

1. **Subject matter** — one of 28 enumerated categories in
   22 NYCRR § 202.70(b), including breach of contract among
   merchants, UCC matters, partnership / corporate dissolution,
   franchise disputes, certain consumer-class actions, certain
   intellectual-property matters
2. **Monetary threshold** — **NY County: $500,000** (excluding
   punitive damages, attorneys' fees, costs, interest). Other
   counties have lower thresholds (Nassau: $200,000; Westchester:
   $200,000; Kings/Bronx/Queens: $150,000; Erie: $50,000;
   Albany: $50,000; etc.).

Commercial Division Rules (22 NYCRR § 202.70(g)) are
substantially more rigorous than the uniform rules: 25-page
limit on memoranda (Rule 17), expedited discovery, mandatory
mediation (Rule 3), accelerated motion practice. Many of
these rules have **migrated to the broader Uniform Civil
Rules** over time (e.g., the 25-page limit became 22 NYCRR
§ 202.8-b in 2021 statewide). Always check the current
text of the operative rule.

## Filing checklist

1. **Commence the action**: file a Summons and Verified
   Complaint (or Summons + Notice / Summons + Complaint) plus
   a Request for Judicial Intervention (RJI, UCS-840) plus the
   $210 index-number fee (CPLR 8018) and the $95 RJI fee
   (where applicable). Issued via NYSCEF.
2. **Note of Issue / RJI**: filing the RJI assigns the case
   to an IAS Justice (22 NYCRR § 202.6). RJI not required at
   commencement but is required before any motion practice.
3. **Service**: under CPLR Article 3 — Summons + Complaint
   on every defendant within 120 days of filing (CPLR
   306-b). Affidavit of service filed via NYSCEF.
4. **Notice of Motion**: schedule a return date under the
   assigned Justice's Part Rules; conform timing to CPLR
   2214(b) — 8-day minimum service period, 16 days for cross-
   motions, longer if the Justice's Part Rules require pre-
   motion letters.

## Discovery in NY County

- **Preliminary Conference** under 22 NYCRR § 202.12 — held
  within 45 days of RJI; sets discovery deadlines
- **Compliance Conference** — mid-discovery checkpoint
- **Note of Issue** — certifies discovery complete (22 NYCRR
  § 202.21); within 90 days of note of issue, parties may
  file dispositive motions
- **Commercial Division Rule 11** allows expedited interim
  discovery practice
