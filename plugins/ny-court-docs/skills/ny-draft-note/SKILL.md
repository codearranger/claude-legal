# Draft a New York Notice of Motion or OSC

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** The Notice of Motion or OSC is the
> document that gets your motion on the court's calendar.
> Errors here can cause the motion to be denied or the
> filing to be rejected by the clerk.

## Choose: Notice of Motion or Order to Show Cause?

| Use | When |
|-----|------|
| **Notice of Motion** (CPLR 2214) | Standard motion practice; no emergency; sufficient time to give 8-day minimum notice |
| **Order to Show Cause** (CPLR 2214(d), 6313) | Emergency relief (TRO); insufficient time for 8-day notice; specific Part Rule requires OSC for certain motion types; ex parte stay of execution; certain CPLR 5015(a) vacatur motions |

OSC requires a Justice's signature on the OSC itself,
typically obtained ex parte; the signed OSC is then served on
the opposing party. Notice of Motion is filed directly via
NYSCEF without judicial pre-signature.
