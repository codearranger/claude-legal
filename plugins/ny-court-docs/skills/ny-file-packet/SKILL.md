# Assemble a New York Court Filing Packet

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Packet preflight catches errors that
> would otherwise cause a clerk rejection or in-court
> ruling against your motion.

## NY court filing systems

| Court | System | URL |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Supreme Court (all counties) + County Court | NYSCEF | https://iappscontent.courts.state.ny.us/NYSCEF/live |
| Civil Court of the City of New York | UCMS / CCEF | https://www.nycourts.gov/courts/nyc/civil/ |
| Family Court | UFC (Universal Family Court) | https://nycourts.gov/courts/nyc/family/ |
| Surrogate's Court | NYSCEF (mostly) | Same as Supreme |
| Nassau / Suffolk District Court | NYSCEF | Same |
| City Courts (upstate) | NYSCEF, variably | Court-by-court |
| Town & Village Justice Courts | Paper-only typically | Local |

## Motion packet components

For a standard motion in Supreme Court via NYSCEF:

1. **Notice of Motion** (or Order to Show Cause) — see
   `ny-draft-note`
2. **Affirmation / Affidavit in Support** — see
   `ny-draft-declaration`
3. **Exhibits** — separate PDFs or single bundled PDF with
   bookmarks (per Part Rules)
4. **Memorandum of Law in Support** — see `ny-draft-motion`
5. **Proposed Order** (if relief involves an order) — see
   `ny-draft-order`
6. **Affidavit of Service** (or NYSCEF service certification)

## NYSCEF assembly conventions

### Bookmarks

Required for any multi-document or multi-exhibit filing.
Bookmark to:

- Start of each document (e.g., "Affirmation of Smith")
- Start of each exhibit (e.g., "Exhibit A — Credit
  Agreement")

### Document type selection

NYSCEF requires selecting a document type from a
controlled dropdown for each upload:

| File | NYSCEF document type |
|------|---------------------|
| Notice of Motion | "Notice of Motion" |
| Order to Show Cause | "Order to Show Cause" |
| Affirmation in Support | "Affirmation in Support" |
| Affidavit in Support | "Affidavit in Support" |
| Memorandum of Law | "Memorandum of Law" |
| Exhibits | "Exhibits" or "Exhibit [Letter]" |
| Proposed Order | "Proposed Order" |
| Affidavit of Service | "Affidavit of Service" |
| Stipulation | "Stipulation" |
| Counter-Order | "Counter Order" |

Mismatched document types are a common rejection cause.

### File specifications

- **Format**: PDF
- **OCR**: text-searchable preferred (image-only allowed
  for true-paper exhibits)
- **Size**: ≤ 100 MB per upload
- **Naming**: descriptive; no special characters
- **Bookmarks**: per above
- **Redaction**: 22 NYCRR § 202.5(e) — redact SSNs, tax
  IDs, financial-account numbers (except last 4 of each),
  birthdates (except year), minors' names (use initials)

## Cross-document consistency check

Before submission, verify every document in the packet
shows:

| Item | Same across packet? |
|------|---|
| Court name | YES |
| County | YES |
| Plaintiff name + role | YES |
| Defendant name + role | YES |
| Index number | YES |
| Justice (if assigned) | YES |
| Part (if assigned) | YES |
| Notice of Motion return date | YES (matches the date in the affirmation's "returnable on") |
| Exhibit letter / number | YES (matches references in affirmation) |

## Service requirement

Most NY motion filings require contemporaneous service:

| Method | Tracking |
|--------|---------|
| NYSCEF e-service (registered parties) | Auto-tracked; certification by NYSCEF |
| Mail (CPLR 2103(b)(2)) | Affidavit of service; 5-day add-on |
| Email by stipulation (CPLR 2103(b)(7), 2103-a) | Email + filed acknowledgment |
| Personal delivery | Affidavit of service |

For pro se filers: if the opposing party is also NYSCEF-
registered, **NYSCEF e-service is automatic and sufficient**;
no separate service required.
