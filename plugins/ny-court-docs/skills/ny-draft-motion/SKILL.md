# Draft a New York Motion

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Applies the pro-se drafting framework adapted
> to New York. Verify the assigned Justice's Part Rules
> before finalizing — page limits, format, courtesy-copy
> requirements, and oral-argument practice vary.

## The standard NY motion packet

A motion in New York Supreme/County Court typically consists
of **four documents**:

1. **Notice of Motion** (CPLR 2214) — the scheduling document
   — see `ny-draft-note`
2. **Affirmation / Affidavit in Support** — sworn statement
   of facts plus the procedural history — see
   `ny-draft-declaration`
3. **Memorandum of Law in Support** — legal argument
4. **Proposed Order** — see `ny-draft-order`

Alternative: **Order to Show Cause (OSC)** packet:

1. **Order to Show Cause** — signed by a Justice; sets the
   hearing date and any TRO
2. **Affirmation / Affidavit in Support**
3. **Memorandum of Law** (optional but recommended)
4. **Proposed Final Order**

OSC is used when:

- Emergency relief is needed (TRO, stay of sale)
- Standard CPLR 2214 notice period is insufficient
- A specific Justice's Part Rules require OSC for certain
  relief

## Page limits — 22 NYCRR § 202.8-b (2021)

Statewide (since 2021):

| Document | Page limit | Word-count alternative |
|----------|-----------|-----------------------|
| Memorandum of Law (initial) | **25 pages** | 7,000 words |
| Reply Memorandum | **15 pages** | 4,200 words |
| Affirmation/Affidavit | No page limit, but practical 25-page guideline |
| Notice of Motion | Typically 1-2 pages |

Word-count alternative permits a more flexible format. Where
the rule permits word-count, prefer it and add a word-count
certification at the foot of the memo.

**Commercial Division (22 NYCRR § 202.70(g) Rule 17)**: same
limits.

## CPLR 2214 service timing

| Service mode | Min. notice before return date |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| Personal delivery | 8 days |
| Mail | 8 + 5 = 13 days |
| NYSCEF (registered parties) | 8 days |

**Cross-motion** (CPLR 2215): must be served at least 7 days
before the return date.

**Reply**: per Part Rules; typically 1 to 7 days before the
return date.

## Affirmation v. affidavit choice

- **Affirmation** (CPLR 2106) — sworn statement by attorney,
  by certain professionals (medical, dental), and since the
  2023 amendment, **by any person**. No notary required.
- **Affidavit** (CPLR 2309) — sworn statement notarized
  under oath. Required pre-2023 for any sworn statement by a
  non-attorney non-professional.

Pro se litigants since 2023 should use **affirmation under
penalty of perjury** (CPLR 2106 as amended; L 2023, ch
559). The text:

> [PRINT NAME], being duly affirmed, hereby affirms the
> truth of the following under penalty of perjury pursuant
> to CPLR 2106:
