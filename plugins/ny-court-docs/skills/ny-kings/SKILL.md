## Distinctives

### High foreclosure / consumer-debt volume

Kings County has historically processed more residential
foreclosures than any other NY county. **CPLR 3408**
mandatory foreclosure settlement conferences apply to every
home-loan foreclosure; the **Kings County Foreclosure
Settlement Conference Part** processes these in a centralized
calendar. Pro se homeowners commonly appear here.

Consumer-debt cases under $50,000 are filed in **Kings County
Civil Court** (141 Livingston Street) under the CCA (Civil
Court Act), not Supreme Court. See `ny-county-courts` for
Civil Court / Civil Court of the City of New York coverage.

### CPLR 3215(g)(3) — additional notice in consumer-credit default applications

In any consumer-credit transaction (the term echoes the new
CPLR 3015(e) and the FDCPA), CPLR 3215(g)(3) requires the
plaintiff to mail a copy of the summons with an extra notice
to the defendant at least 20 days before any default
application. Kings County clerks have historically rejected
default applications missing this notice. This rule was
*expanded* by the 2022 CCFA via 22 NYCRR § 202.27-a — see
`ny-consumer-debt`.

### IAS Part assignment in Kings County

After RJI, the case routes to an IAS Part under 22 NYCRR
§ 202.3. Kings County Part Rules: https://ww2.nycourts.gov/
courts/2jd/kings/civil/Civil_Part_Rules.shtml — verify the
assigned Justice's current rules every time, because page
limits, motion-conference requirements, and submission
protocols differ substantially across Parts.

### CPLR 4544 — small-print contracts

Kings County consumer cases routinely involve credit-card
agreements in small print. **CPLR 4544** bars admission of
any contract whose printed type is smaller than 8 points
unless a true and complete copy is provided. This is a
standard objection in Kings County consumer-debt defense —
see `ny-consumer-debt`.

## Filing checklist

1. **NYSCEF**: file Summons + Complaint via NYSCEF; pay $210
   index-number fee
2. **RJI**: file the RJI (UCS-840) before motion practice
   ($95 fee in commenced cases)
3. **Service**: CPLR Article 3 — within 120 days under CPLR
   306-b
4. **Preliminary Conference**: scheduled by the assigned
   IAS Part under 22 NYCRR § 202.12
5. **Notice of Motion**: returnable before the assigned IAS
   Part; conform timing to CPLR 2214(b) plus the Justice's
   Part Rules

## Common Kings County filings

- **Foreclosure settlement conference notice** under CPLR
  3408
- **Pre-answer motion to dismiss** under CPLR 3211 (often
  raising statute-of-limitations defense under the new CPLR
  213(a) 3-year SOL — see `ny-consumer-debt`)
- **Order to Show Cause** (CPLR 2214(d)) — common in
  emergency foreclosure cases (e.g., to stay sale)
