## How to refresh

```bash
# Without proxy (CI runners, Cloudflare-trusted IPs):
python3 scripts/pull_ny_court_rules.py --workers 4

# With warpsocks (developer workstation behind a residential IP
# that Cloudflare's bot-fight mode would otherwise challenge):
NY_RULES_PROXY=http://192.168.8.21:9091 \
  python3 scripts/pull_ny_court_rules.py --workers 4
```

The puller:

1. **Fetches via curl_cffi** with Chrome TLS impersonation, which
   defeats Cloudflare's bot-detection that previously blocked the
   `urllib`-based puller. Install with
   `pip install --break-system-packages curl_cffi` if needed.
2. **Optional warpsocks proxy** routes traffic through Cloudflare
   Warp via the `NY_RULES_PROXY` env var, giving the puller a
   Cloudflare-trusted source IP for sites that geo-fence by ASN.
3. **Falls back to pointer stubs** when the upstream returns a
   Cloudflare interstitial despite the curl_cffi + proxy
   combination (rare). Stubs document the canonical URL.
4. **Never regresses substantive content to a stub.** If a previous
   refresh wrote real Markdown and the current refresh would only
   produce a stub, the existing file is kept in place.
