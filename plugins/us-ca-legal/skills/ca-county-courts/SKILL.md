# California county superior courts (non-LA / non-SF)

Use this skill in addition to `ca-statewide-format` when filing
in any California superior court other than Los Angeles or San
Francisco Superior Courts.

California has 58 counties and 58 superior courts (one per
county, consolidated under the Trial Court Unification Act of
1998). Each court has its own local rules, tentative-ruling
practices, and eFiling systems. The nine courts below account
for the second tier of case volume after Los Angeles and San
Francisco.

## County / venue table — California's most-populous counties (after LA and SF)

| County | Population | Main courthouse / address | Web portal |
|--------|------------|--------------------------|-----------|
| San Diego | ~3.3 M | Hall of Justice, 330 W. Broadway, San Diego 92101 | sdcourt.ca.gov |
| Orange | ~3.2 M | Central Justice Center, 700 Civic Center Dr. W., Santa Ana 92701 | occourts.org |
| Riverside | ~2.4 M | 4100 Main St., Riverside 92501 | riverside.courts.ca.gov |
| San Bernardino | ~2.2 M | 247 W. Third St., San Bernardino 92415 | sb-court.org |
| Santa Clara | ~1.9 M | Old Courthouse, 161 N. First St., San Jose 95113 | scscourt.org |
| Alameda | ~1.7 M | René C. Davidson Courthouse, 1225 Fallon St., Oakland 94612 | alameda.courts.ca.gov |
| Sacramento | ~1.6 M | Gordon D. Schaber Courthouse, 720 9th St., Sacramento 95814 | saccourt.ca.gov |
| Contra Costa | ~1.2 M | A.F. Bray Courthouse, 1020 Ward St., Martinez 94553 | cc-courts.org |
| Fresno | ~1.0 M | B.F. Sisk Federal Building / Hall of Records, 1100 Van Ness Ave., Fresno 93724 | fresnosuperiorcourt.org |

Always verify current addresses and contacts at the court's
website — courthouses move divisions between locations.

## Caption — county variant

The court name line uses "COUNTY OF [NAME]":

```
              IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA
                   COUNTY OF ORANGE
```

Case number formats vary by county (see per-county notes below).

## eFiling systems

Unlike Oregon's uniform statewide File and Serve, California
courts use a **patchwork of eFiling vendors**:

| County | eFiling vendor | Portal |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| San Diego | Tyler (Odyssey eFileCA) | sdcourt.ca.gov/efiling |
| Orange | Tyler (Odyssey eFileCA) | occourts.org/online-services/ |
| Riverside | Tyler (Odyssey eFileCA) | riverside.courts.ca.gov |
| San Bernardino | Tyler (Odyssey eFileCA) via eFileSB | efiling.sb-court.org |
| Santa Clara | Tyler (Odyssey eFileCA) | scscourt.org/online-services/ |
| Alameda | File & ServeXpress | fileandservexpress.com |
| Sacramento | Tyler (Odyssey eFileCA) | saccourt.ca.gov/efiling |
| Contra Costa | Tyler (Odyssey eFileCA) | cc-courts.org |
| Fresno | Tyler (Odyssey eFileCA) | fresnosuperiorcourt.org |

**All** accept PDF only; file-size limits typically 10-25 MB
per document. For self-represented filers: eFiling is generally
voluntary (courts accept paper at the clerk's counter during
business hours), but represented parties in civil cases are
typically required to eFile.

## Tentative rulings

All nine courts below use a **tentative-ruling system** for most
civil law-and-motion matters under Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1308(a)(1). The statewide rule: tentatives posted by 2:00-4:00
p.m. the court day before the hearing; contest by calling the
department by 4:00 p.m.; if uncontested, the tentative becomes
the order without a hearing.

**Per-court posting time and contest window** — check the local
rules of each court; the statewide rule 3.1308 sets the floor.

Always verify the case number on the court's case portal before

case type.

## Statewide civil motion notice requirements

All California superior courts follow Code Civ. Proc., § 1005(b):

- **16 court days' notice** for most civil motions filed in
  unlimited civil
- Add **5 calendar days** if service is by first-class mail
- Add **2 court days** if service is by overnight courier
- **No addition** for electronic or personal service
- **75-day notice** for motions for summary judgment (Code Civ.
  Proc., § 437c(a)); opposition due 14 days before hearing;
  reply due 5 days before

Court days = all days except Saturdays, Sundays, and judicial
holidays listed in Code Civ. Proc., § 135.

## Filing fees — statewide schedule

All California superior courts follow the Government Code fee
schedule (Gov. Code, §§ 70600-70679). Current filing fees:

- Complaint (unlimited civil, first paper): $435 (Gov. Code,
  § 70611)
- Complaint (limited civil, over $10,000): $225
- Answer (first paper): same as complaint — $435 or $225
  (Gov. Code, § 70612)
- Motion (unlimited civil): $60 (Gov. Code, § 70617)
- Summary judgment motion: $500 (Gov. Code, § 70617(e))
- Demurrer: $60

Fee waiver: Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.50-3.63; Judicial
Council form FW-001.

Fees are adjusted annually; pull current amounts from:
**https://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm** (filter "fees") or the
specific court's website.

## Document set (typical for any California county)

1. Notice of Motion and Motion (with date, time, dept., judge,
   and reservation number if applicable)
2. Memorandum of Points and Authorities (may be combined with
   motion or filed separately)
3. Supporting Declaration(s) with exhibits
4. Proposed Order ("[PROPOSED] ORDER" as title)
5. Separate Statement (required for discovery motions — CRC
   3.1345)
6. Proof of Service (POS-030 or declaration of service)

The **timing** of the reservation (before or at filing) and the
**contest deadline** for tentatives varies by county — check the
local rules for the specific court.

## Scheduling tip — confirm department practices

Every California superior court department has its own
preferences and standing orders. Before filing any motion:

1. Check the court's website for the assigned department's
   standing orders
2. Confirm whether the department uses a centralized reservation
   system (like LASC's CRS) or accepts direct calls to the
   clerk's counter
3. Download the department's standing order if posted — many
   judges post preferred format requirements, briefing-schedule
   variations, and courtesy-copy requirements
