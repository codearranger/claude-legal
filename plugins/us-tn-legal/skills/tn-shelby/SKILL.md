# Shelby County Trial Courts (Memphis — 30th Judicial District)

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Drafting and filing guidance only. Verify
> every step against the current Shelby County local rules and the
> assigned judge's or chancellor's practice preferences before filing.

Use this skill in addition to `tn-statewide-format` when the case is
in a **Shelby County** trial court. Shelby County (Memphis) is the
**30th Judicial District** and is Tennessee's most populous county.

## The Shelby County trial courts

| Court | Jurisdiction | Clerk |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| **Circuit Court** | Actions at law; civil damages, tort, contract; divorce; jury trials | Circuit Court Clerk |
| **Chancery Court** | Equity; injunctions, declaratory judgments, business/real-property matters; divorce | **Clerk & Master** |
| **General Sessions Court (Civil)** | Limited jurisdiction; civil warrants; detainer (eviction) warrants — see `tn-general-sessions` | General Sessions Court Clerk |
| **Juvenile Court** | Title 37 matters — parentage/custody/support of children of unmarried parents, dependency & neglect, delinquency — see `tn-juvenile-court` | Juvenile Court Clerk |

Both **Circuit and Chancery** have subject-matter jurisdiction over
divorce. See `tn-family-law` for forum selection.

## Caption — Shelby County variants

```
        IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF SHELBY COUNTY, TENNESSEE

[PLAINTIFF],                           )
       Plaintiff,                      )
v.                                     )   Docket No. ____________
[DEFENDANT],                           )
       Defendant.                      )

                  [DOCUMENT TITLE IN ALL CAPS]
```

For **Chancery Court**, the court identifier line reads
`IN THE CHANCERY COURT OF SHELBY COUNTY, TENNESSEE, AT MEMPHIS` and
the matter is heard by a **Chancellor** with the **Clerk & Master** as
clerk. Confirm the exact "for/of" preposition and "AT MEMPHIS" tag
against current Shelby County local-rule caption forms. For
**General Sessions**, see `tn-general-sessions`.

## Local rules — pull the current set every time

There is **no statewide page/margin/font rule** in Tennessee (see
`tn-statewide-format`). The Shelby County Circuit, Chancery, and
General Sessions courts each publish **local rules of practice** that
control page limits, chambers copies, motion-docket scheduling, and
e-filing requirements, indexed on the Administrative Office of the
Courts "Local Rules of Practice" page at **tncourts.gov** and on the
Shelby County courts' sites.

**Agent behavior:** before drafting a notice, scheduling a hearing, or
setting a page-limited brief, fetch the current Shelby County local
rules for the controlling court and division. Confirm the
motion-docket day, chambers-copy requirements, and proposed-order
format.

## Filing — eFlex

- **Shelby County Circuit Court and Chancery Court** use **eFlex** for
  electronic filing. Confirm whether e-filing is mandatory for the
  document type and party, and confirm the current account / training
  requirements.
- **General Sessions** filing mechanics are published by the
  General Sessions Court Clerk; confirm the current platform.
- The **appellate** courts use the statewide AOC e-filing portal.

See `tn-file-packet` for the packet-assembly workflow.

## Motion practice and summary judgment

- **Answer**: 30 days after service of the summons and complaint
  (Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.01).
- **Summary judgment**: served at least **30 days before the hearing**
  (Tenn. R. Civ. P. 56.04); response due no later than 5 days before
  the hearing; the *Celotex*-style standard restored by
  *Rye v. Women's Care Center of Memphis, MPLLC*, 477 S.W.3d 235
  (Tenn. 2015) governs. See `tn-first-30-days`.
- Confirm the local motion-docket scheduling rule and whether the
  division decides motions on the briefs or sets oral argument.
