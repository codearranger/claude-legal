# Davidson County Trial Courts (Nashville — 20th Judicial District)

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Drafting and filing guidance only. Verify
> every step against the current Davidson County local rules and the
> assigned judge's or chancellor's practice preferences before filing.

Use this skill in addition to `tn-statewide-format` when the case is
in a **Davidson County** trial court. Davidson County is the
**20th Judicial District** and is coextensive with the
**Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County**
("Metro") — a consolidated city-county government, so the county and
the city of Nashville share one government and one set of courts.

## The Davidson County trial courts

| Court | Jurisdiction | Clerk |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| **Circuit Court** | Actions at law; civil damages, tort, contract; divorce; jury trials | Circuit Court Clerk |
| **Chancery Court** | Equity; injunctions, declaratory judgments, many business/real-property matters; divorce | **Clerk & Master** |
| **General Sessions Court (Civil)** | Limited jurisdiction; civil warrants; detainer (eviction) warrants — see `tn-general-sessions` | General Sessions Clerk |
| **Juvenile Court** | Title 37 matters — parentage/custody/support of children of unmarried parents, dependency & neglect, delinquency — see `tn-juvenile-court` | Juvenile Court Clerk |

Both **Circuit and Chancery** have subject-matter jurisdiction over
divorce. Choose the forum based on the relief sought and local
practice; see `tn-family-law`.

        IN THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR DAVIDSON COUNTY, TENNESSEE

[PLAINTIFF],                           )
       Plaintiff,                      )
v.                                     )   Docket No. ____________
[DEFENDANT],                           )
       Defendant.                      )

                  [DOCUMENT TITLE IN ALL CAPS]
```

For **Chancery Court**, the court identifier line reads
`IN THE CHANCERY COURT FOR DAVIDSON COUNTY, TENNESSEE, AT NASHVILLE`
and the matter is heard by a **Chancellor** with the **Clerk & Master**
as clerk. For **General Sessions**, see `tn-general-sessions` — civil
matters there are commenced by a **civil warrant**, not a captioned
complaint.

## Local rules — pull the current set every time

There is **no statewide page/margin/font rule** in Tennessee (see
`tn-statewide-format`). Davidson County's Circuit, Chancery, and
General Sessions courts each publish **local rules of practice** that
control page limits, chambers copies, motion-docket scheduling, and
e-filing requirements. They are indexed on the Administrative Office
of the Courts "Local Rules of Practice" page at **tncourts.gov** and
on the Davidson County clerks' sites.

**Agent behavior:** before drafting a notice, scheduling a hearing, or
setting a page-limited brief, fetch the current Davidson County local
rules for the controlling court and the assigned division. Confirm the
motion-docket day, any chambers-copy requirement, and the
proposed-order format.

## Filing — e-filing platform varies by court

- **Davidson County Chancery Court** uses **eFileTN / Odyssey
  (Tyler Technologies)** for electronic filing. Confirm whether
  e-filing is mandatory for the document type and party.
- **Circuit Court** and **General Sessions** filing mechanics are
  published by their respective clerks; confirm the current platform
  and whether paper filing is still accepted.
- The **appellate** courts use the statewide AOC e-filing portal.

Confirm the controlling platform and account requirements before
assembling a packet; see `tn-file-packet`.

## Motion practice and summary judgment

Davidson County motion practice runs on the Tennessee Rules of Civil
Procedure plus the court's local motion-docket rules:

- **Answer**: 30 days after service of the summons and complaint
  (Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.01).
- **Summary judgment**: the motion must be served at least **30 days
  before the hearing** (Tenn. R. Civ. P. 56.04); the adverse party's
  response is due no later than 5 days before the hearing. The
  governing standard is the *Celotex*-style standard restored by
  *Rye v. Women's Care Center of Memphis, MPLLC*, 477 S.W.3d 235
  (Tenn. 2015). See `tn-first-30-days`.
- Confirm the local motion-docket scheduling rule and whether the
  division decides motions on the briefs or sets oral argument.
