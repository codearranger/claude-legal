# Knox County Trial Courts (Knoxville — 6th Judicial District)

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Drafting and filing guidance only. Verify
> every step against the current Knox County local rules and the
> assigned judge's or chancellor's practice preferences before filing.

Use this skill in addition to `tn-statewide-format` when the case is
in a **Knox County** trial court. Knox County (Knoxville) is the
**6th Judicial District**.

## The Knox County trial courts

| Court | Jurisdiction | Clerk |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| **Circuit Court** | Actions at law; civil damages, tort, contract; divorce; jury trials | Circuit Court Clerk |
| **Chancery Court** | Equity; injunctions, declaratory judgments, business/real-property matters; divorce; child-support magistrate matters | **Clerk & Master** |
| **General Sessions Court (Civil)** | Limited jurisdiction; civil warrants; detainer (eviction) warrants — see `tn-general-sessions` | General Sessions Court Clerk |
| **Juvenile Court** | Title 37 matters — parentage/custody/support of children of unmarried parents, dependency & neglect, delinquency — see `tn-juvenile-court` | Juvenile Court Clerk |

Both **Circuit and Chancery** have subject-matter jurisdiction over
divorce. See `tn-family-law`.

### Child-support magistrate practice in Chancery

Knox County Chancery Court hears certain **child-support** matters
before a **magistrate** (a referee/special master who hears and
recommends, with the chancellor confirming). When filing a
child-support matter in Knox Chancery, confirm whether the matter is
set before a magistrate, the magistrate's docket day, and the local
procedure for **filing exceptions / requesting rehearing** of the
magistrate's findings before the chancellor. Verify the current
magistrate-practice local rule before relying on any deadline.

                  [DOCUMENT TITLE IN ALL CAPS]
```

For **Chancery Court**, the court identifier line reads
`IN THE CHANCERY COURT FOR KNOX COUNTY, TENNESSEE` (some clerks add
"AT KNOXVILLE") and the matter is heard by a **Chancellor** with the
**Clerk & Master** as clerk. For **General Sessions**, see
`tn-general-sessions`.

## Local rules — pull the current set every time

There is **no statewide page/margin/font rule** in Tennessee (see
`tn-statewide-format`). The Knox County courts publish **local rules
of practice** controlling page limits, chambers copies, motion-docket
scheduling, magistrate practice, and filing mechanics, indexed on the
Administrative Office of the Courts "Local Rules of Practice" page at
**tncourts.gov**.

**Agent behavior:** before drafting a notice, scheduling a hearing, or
setting a brief, fetch the current Knox County local rules for the
controlling court and division. Confirm the motion-docket day,
chambers-copy requirement, e-filing platform, and (for child-support)
the magistrate procedure.

## Motion practice and summary judgment

- **Answer**: 30 days after service of the summons and complaint
  (Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.01).
- **Summary judgment**: served at least **30 days before the hearing**
  (Tenn. R. Civ. P. 56.04); response due no later than 5 days before
  the hearing; the *Celotex*-style standard of
  *Rye v. Women's Care Center of Memphis, MPLLC*, 477 S.W.3d 235
  (Tenn. 2015) governs. See `tn-first-30-days`.
