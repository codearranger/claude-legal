  This skill should be used to scaffold a Michigan Notice of Hearing —
  the document that places a motion on the court's calendar — and the
  related party-filed notices in Michigan civil practice. Triggers
  include "Michigan notice of hearing", "notice a motion for hearing
  Michigan", "MCR 2.119(C) notice", "schedule motion hearing notice",
  "draft a notice of hearing for my motion", "set my motion for hearing
  in Michigan". The scheduling document in Michigan is a Notice of
  Hearing (NOT a "Note for Motion Docket" or a "Notice of Motion").
  Under MCR 2.119(C) a written motion and a notice of the time and
  place of hearing must be served, and the proof of service follows
  MCR 2.107. Composes with `mi-statewide-format` for the caption,
  `mi-schedule-hearing` for obtaining the hearing date, and
  `mi-draft-motion` for the underlying motion.

# Draft a Michigan Notice of Hearing

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** This skill scaffolds a notice document as a
> drafting aid. Verify the filing court's local rules and the assigned
> judge's practice — especially how hearing dates are obtained and the
> minimum notice period — against current law before filing.

In Michigan civil practice the document that places a motion on the
court's calendar is the **Notice of Hearing**. It tells all parties
when and where the court will hear a previously filed motion. Michigan
does **not** use a "Note for Motion Docket" or a freestanding "Notice
of Motion" — the motion and the notice of hearing travel together.

## MCR 2.119(C) — the motion-and-notice requirement

Under **MCR 2.119(C)**, a written motion (other than one that may be
heard ex parte), the notice of the time and place of the hearing, and
any supporting brief or affidavits must be **served** on the other
parties. The rule sets a **minimum notice period** before the hearing,
with a longer period when service is by mail.

- Do **not** hard-code the day count here. Confirm the exact minimum
  notice period (and the mail add-on) in the current text of MCR
  2.119(C) via `mi-law-references`, and compute the date with
  `mi-deadlines`.
- The notice period runs **backward** from the hearing date: the
  motion + notice must be served at least the rule's minimum number of
  days before the hearing. Building in the mail-service add-on and any
  longer local-rule period is the filer's responsibility.
- Some motions may be **heard ex parte** or decided **without oral
  argument** under MCR 2.119(E) (the court may dispense with oral
  argument). Confirm whether the motion at hand requires a noticed
  hearing at all before scheduling one.

## Get the hearing date first

Michigan trial courts vary in how a motion hearing date is obtained.
Many circuit and district courts require the filer to **secure a
motion date** from the assigned judge's clerk or the court's motion
calendar before the Notice of Hearing can state a date; some run a
standing motion day. Practice differs by court and by judge.

- **Use `mi-schedule-hearing`** for the mechanics of obtaining or
  coordinating the date with the court before noticing the motion.
- **Check the local rules** of the filing court and the assigned
  judge's practice guidelines.
- Confirm the appearance method (in person vs. remote) — many Michigan
  courts hold motion hearings by videoconference under MCR 2.407 and
  the Michigan Trial Court Standards for the use of video technology.

## Proof of service — MCR 2.107

Service of the motion and Notice of Hearing on every other party is
governed by **MCR 2.107** (manner of service; service on the attorney
of record where a party is represented). The filing must include a
**proof of service** stating the date, manner, and recipients. The
notice period under MCR 2.119(C) is measured from the date of service,
so the proof-of-service date is what fixes whether the minimum notice
was satisfied.
