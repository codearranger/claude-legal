# 36th District Court (Detroit)

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Drafting and filing guidance only. District
> court deadlines — especially in summary proceedings — are short and
> unforgiving. Verify every date and every local-rule requirement
> against the current Michigan Court Rules and the court's own
> administrative orders before acting.

Use this skill in addition to `mi-statewide-format` whenever a civil
case is in the **36th District Court**, located at **421 Madison
Street, Detroit, MI 48226**. It is the **largest district court in
Michigan and one of the busiest courts in the United States** — and
the **dominant consumer-debt and eviction forum** in the state: high
volume, short summary-proceedings timelines, and a very large
default-judgment docket.

## What kind of court this is

Michigan **district courts** are limited-jurisdiction trial courts.
General civil practice runs under the **MCR 2.xxx** rules as modified
for district court, while three specialized civil tracks are governed
by their own rules:

- **General civil** — money claims up to the district-court civil
  jurisdiction cap. Above the cap, the matter belongs in Circuit
  Court (in Detroit, the Wayne County / Third Circuit — see
  `mi-wayne`). **Confirm the current cap in the corpus** before
  relying on it.
- **Landlord-tenant / summary proceedings** — recovery of possession
  under **MCL 600.5701 et seq.** and **MCR 4.201** (see below).
- **Small claims** — informal, no-lawyer, no-appeal track under
  **MCR 4.301 et seq.** and **MCL 600.8401 et seq.** (see below).

## Divisions

The 36th District Court is organized into functional divisions:

- **Civil Division** — general civil and landlord-tenant matters.
- **Small Claims Division** — small-value disputes (in-person
  proceedings; confirm the current courtroom/calendar with the
  clerk).
- **Traffic Division** and **Criminal Division** — out of scope for
  this civil-drafting skill.
- **Collections / Enforcement** — post-judgment collection and
  garnishment processing.

## Commencing and noticing a case

- A general civil action is commenced by filing a **complaint** with
  the clerk, who issues a **summons**; the plaintiff serves the
  summons and complaint under the MCR 2.105 service rules. Use
  `mi-statewide-format` for the caption, numbered paragraphs, the
  P-number signature block, and the proof of service.
- A **summary proceeding** is commenced by a **complaint to recover
  possession** preceded by the statutorily required **demand /
  notice** (e.g., notice to quit / demand for possession) — see the
  landlord-tenant section below.
- A **small-claims** matter is commenced on an **SCAO affidavit and
  claim** form, not a formal Rule 2.113 pleading.

## Landlord-tenant / summary proceedings — the eviction docket

Summary proceedings to recover possession are the 36th District
Court's highest-volume civil docket. Key mechanics:

- **Governing law: MCL 600.5701 et seq.** (summary proceedings) and
  **MCR 4.201** (procedure). The matter is filed in the Civil
  Division.
- **Pre-suit notice is a prerequisite.** The landlord must serve the
  correct **demand for possession / notice to quit** (the type and
  notice period depend on the ground — nonpayment, termination,
  health/safety, etc.) before filing the complaint. A notice defect
  is a common and dispositive defense.
- **Compressed timeline.** Summary proceedings move on a **much
  shorter clock** than ordinary civil cases — short summons-return
  windows and prompt hearing dates. Treat every date as
  jurisdictional and verify it against MCR 4.201 and the court's
  scheduling practice.
- **SCAO mandatory forms** govern the summons, complaint, and
  judgment in summary proceedings; use the current SCAO form set.

For the substantive defense framework — habitability, retaliation,
the Truth in Renting Act, security-deposit issues, notice defects,
and any federal notice overlay where applicable — see
`mi-landlord-tenant`.

## Small claims

- **Governing law: MCR 4.301 et seq.** and **MCL 600.8401 et seq.**
- **Informal, no-attorney, no-jury** track. Parties generally may not
  be represented by counsel, there is **no formal discovery**, and a
  small-claims **judgment is not appealable** (a party who wants the
  right to appeal or to be represented must instead remove the case
  to the general civil docket before trial — confirm the current
  removal mechanics).
- **Monetary cap is statutory and periodically adjusted for
  inflation.** **Do not assume a fixed dollar figure — confirm the
  current small-claims cap in the corpus** (`mi-law-references`)
  before advising on forum choice.

## Consumer-debt and the default-judgment docket

The 36th District Court processes an enormous volume of
**consumer-debt collection** suits, and a large share resolve by
**default judgment** when the defendant does not appear. That makes
the consumer-protection posture important:

- A defendant who is served must **respond by the deadline** to avoid
  a default; once a default judgment enters, relief runs through the
  post-judgment / set-aside rules (see `mi-post-judgment`).
- Debt-buyer plaintiffs must be able to prove **standing / chain of
  title** and the **business-records foundation** (MRE 803(6) /
  902(11)) for the account documents — frequently weak points in a
  high-volume docket.
- Federal and Michigan collection-practice law (FDCPA, Regulation F,
  and the Michigan collection statutes) supply both defenses and
  affirmative claims.

See `mi-consumer-debt` for the full debt-defense framework (FDCPA,
Reg F, the Michigan consumer-protection and collection-agency
regimes, statutes of limitation, and chain-of-title challenges) and
`mi-first-30-days` for answering and avoiding default.

## E-filing (MiFILE / MiCOURT)

Michigan's statewide electronic-filing system is **MiFILE** (the
MiCOURT TrueFiling platform). The 36th District Court accepts
electronic filing through the state system; certain post-judgment
collection items (e.g., garnishments) route through dedicated
electronic workflows. Confirm the current filing channel, document
types, and any fee with the clerk and the court's website before
filing — see `mi-file-packet` for packet assembly and preflight.

## Caption / court identifier

For documents filed in this court, use the district-court identifier
line in the caption:

```
   STATE OF MICHIGAN
   IN THE 36TH DISTRICT COURT
```

Follow the caption fields, numbered-paragraph form, P-number
signature block, and proof-of-service conventions in
`mi-statewide-format`. Use the current **SCAO mandatory forms** for
summary proceedings and small claims rather than free-form pleadings.

## Composition

- For statewide format and the caption: `mi-statewide-format`
- For consumer-debt defense: `mi-consumer-debt`
- For eviction / summary-proceedings defense: `mi-landlord-tenant`
- For answering and avoiding default in the first 30 days:
  `mi-first-30-days`
- For default set-aside and post-judgment relief: `mi-post-judgment`
- For deadline computation: `mi-deadlines`
- For pro se conventions: `mi-pro-se`
- For e-filing packet assembly: `mi-file-packet`
- For other Michigan district courts: `mi-district-courts`
- For the companion Wayne County Circuit Court (over-cap matters):
  `mi-wayne`
