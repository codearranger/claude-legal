# Michigan — First 30 Days After Service

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Time is short. This skill helps a defendant
> sketch a response and surface the most important deadlines, but
> consult a licensed Michigan attorney about substantive defenses when
> possible.

Use this skill when the defendant has **just been served** with a
civil summons and complaint in a Michigan **circuit court** or
**district court**. It frames the response window — the time in which
the defendant must answer, move for summary disposition, or risk
default.

## The clock — MCR 2.108

| Event | Deadline | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Answer — personally served within Michigan | **21 days** after service | MCR 2.108(A)(1) |
| Answer — served by mail, or served outside Michigan | **28 days** after service | MCR 2.108(A) |
| Answer to a counterclaim / cross-claim | **21 days** after service | MCR 2.108(A) |
| Responsive pleading after the court rules on a motion | per the order; default **21 days** after notice if no time set | MCR 2.108(C) |

These are the **stable** statutory-style day counts; still confirm
against the current MCR 2.108 (the rule sets several sub-deadlines by
service mode), and compute the actual due date with `mi-deadlines`
(MCR 1.108 time computation + MCR 2.107(C)(3) mail add-on).

> ⚠ **Default risk.** If the defendant neither answers nor moves
> within the window, the plaintiff may take the defendant's **default**
> under MCR 2.603 and then seek a **default judgment**. Setting a
> default aside later is hard — see the MCR 2.603 standard below and
> `mi-post-judgment`.

## Day-by-day playbook

### Days 0-3 — read the complaint, check the summons

- **Read every numbered paragraph.** Note who is suing, on what
  claims, for what relief, and what contracts / accounts / events are
  alleged.
- **Note the court, county, and case number** — these go on every
  filing (`mi-statewide-format` caption).
- **Check the summons expiration** (MCR 2.102(D)) and **check service**
  under MCR 2.105. Defective service is a defense — preserve it (the
  MCR 2.116(C)(1)-(C)(3) grounds below).
- **Note the court level**: circuit court (general civil, over
  $25,000) vs. district court (up to $25,000; small claims division).

### Days 3-10 — choose the response strategy

Three principal paths:

1. **Answer** — admit, deny, or plead lack of knowledge for each
   numbered paragraph (MCR 2.111(C)-(D)); **state affirmative defenses
   in a separate, clearly designated section** (MCR 2.111(F) — see the
   trap below); assert any counterclaims (MCR 2.203).
2. **Motion for Summary Disposition** under MCR 2.116 — may be filed
   in lieu of or together with an answer; see the grounds below.
3. **Motion for More Definite Statement** (MCR 2.115(A)) — when the
   pleading is too vague to answer. Disfavored; rarely granted.

> ⚠ **MICHIGAN AFFIRMATIVE-DEFENSE TRAP — MCR 2.111(F).** In Michigan,
> affirmative defenses must be **stated in a separate, clearly labeled
> section of a responsive pleading** (and a defense raised by a
> responsive pleading is **deemed waived if not stated**). Burying a
> defense in the body of denials, or omitting it entirely, **waives**
> it. This includes statute of limitations, release, payment, statute
> of frauds, lack of standing / chain of title, and the other
> MCR 2.111(F)(3) defenses. **Always plead affirmative defenses under
> their own heading**, even where they overlap with summary-disposition
> grounds. Verify the current text of MCR 2.111(F) before filing.

### Summary disposition — MCR 2.116

Michigan does not use a "motion to dismiss" / "motion for summary
judgment" split. **Both** are folded into one motion for **summary
disposition** under MCR 2.116(C), with the ground identified by
subrule:

| Subrule | Ground |
|---|---|
| **(C)(1)** | lack of subject-matter jurisdiction |
| **(C)(2)** | lack of personal jurisdiction |
| **(C)(3)** | insufficiency of process / service of process |
| **(C)(4)** | claim within another tribunal's exclusive jurisdiction (verify) |
| **(C)(5)** | party lacks legal capacity to sue |
| **(C)(6)** | another action pending between the same parties on the same claim |
| **(C)(7)** | claim barred — **statute of limitations, release, prior judgment / res judicata, immunity, payment, statute of frauds, infancy/disability**, etc. |
| **(C)(8)** | **failure to state a claim** on which relief can be granted — tested on the **pleadings alone** |
| **(C)(9)** | failure to state a valid defense |
| **(C)(10)** | **no genuine issue of material fact** — tested on **documentary evidence**, the rough analog to federal summary judgment |

> **(C)(8) vs. (C)(10) — different records.** A **(C)(8)** motion tests
> the legal sufficiency of the complaint on the **pleadings alone**;
> the court accepts the well-pleaded allegations as true and may not
> consider outside evidence. A **(C)(10)** motion is decided on
> **affidavits, depositions, admissions, and other documentary
> evidence**, viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving
> party. The governing standard is set out in *Maiden v Rozwood*, 461
> Mich 109 (1999) — **verify the citation and holding** before relying
> on it. Do not attach evidence to a (C)(8) motion; if a fact dispute
> matters, move under (C)(10). The standards and timing are developed
> in `mi-draft-motion`; this skill flags them at a pointer level.

> **Preserve the threatened defenses.** Lack of personal jurisdiction,
> improper process, and improper service ((C)(1)-(C)(3) grounds) can be
> **waived** if not raised at the first opportunity — raise them by
> motion under MCR 2.116 **or** plead them, consistent with
> MCR 2.116(D). Verify the current waiver rule.

### Days 10-28 — draft the answer (or the motion)

#### Answer structure (MCR 2.111)

```
                              ANSWER,
                AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES, AND COUNTERCLAIM

   Defendant [Name] answers Plaintiff's Complaint as follows:

                              ANSWER
   1. Defendant admits the allegations in paragraph 1.
   2. Defendant denies the allegations in paragraph 2.
   3. Defendant lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a
      belief as to paragraph 3 and leaves Plaintiff to its proofs.
   [...]

                       AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES
            (separate section — MCR 2.111(F); omission waives)
   1. Plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations.
   2. Plaintiff lacks standing / chain of title to the alleged debt.
   3. [Release / payment / accord & satisfaction / statute of frauds /
      failure to state a claim / etc.]

                            COUNTERCLAIM
   [If asserting one, plead it complaint-style with numbered factual
   allegations and named counts — MCR 2.203.]

                       DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL
   Defendant demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
```

#### Affirmative-defense catalog — MCR 2.111(F)

Plead **all** that may apply, each in the **separate** defenses
section. Common Michigan defenses:

- Statute of limitations (very common — verify the period against
  `mi-statutes-debt` / the relevant subject bundle)
- Payment / accord and satisfaction / release
- Discharge in bankruptcy
- Statute of frauds
- Estoppel / waiver / laches
- Failure of consideration / fraud / illegality
- Res judicata / collateral estoppel (prior judgment)
- Lack of standing / chain of title (debt-buyer cases — see
  `mi-consumer-debt`)
- Failure to state a claim (MCR 2.116(C)(8))
- Governmental immunity (claims against public actors)

### Counterclaims, cross-claims, joinder — MCR 2.203

- **MCR 2.203(A) — compulsory joinder of claims.** A pleader must join
  every claim it has against the opposing party that arises out of the
  **transaction or occurrence** that is the subject of the action, or
  the claim may be **barred**. Plead all known related counterclaims
  with the answer.
- **MCR 2.203(B)** — permissive joinder of unrelated claims.
- **Cross-claims** against co-parties are also governed by MCR 2.203.
- Verify the current MCR 2.203 text and the scope of the bar.

### Demand for jury — MCR 2.508

A party who wants a jury must **file and serve a written demand**
within the time fixed by MCR 2.508(B) (tied to the close of pleadings)
and pay the jury fee. **Failure to demand within the window waives the
jury right.** Include the demand in the answer (as above) or file it
separately within the rule's window; confirm the current timing in
MCR 2.508.

### Setting aside a default — MCR 2.603

If a default has already entered, MCR 2.603(D) allows it to be set
aside only on a showing of **good cause** *and* a **verified statement
of facts showing a meritorious defense** (except for a defect in personal
jurisdiction). The motion must be timely. This is a demanding standard
— do not rely on it as a fallback for missing the answer window.
Default-judgment vacatur is developed in `mi-post-judgment`.

## Filing the answer / motion

- **File** with the clerk of the circuit or district court named in
  the caption (confirm the court's e-filing platform — MiFILE /
  TrueFiling where mandated; otherwise paper).
- **Serve** all parties under MCR 2.107 and include proof of service.
- **Sign** under MCR 1.109(E) (signature certifies the pleading is
  well-grounded; sanctions attach to violations).

## Composition

- Format / caption: `mi-statewide-format`
- Drafting + the *Maiden v Rozwood* summary-disposition standard:
  `mi-draft-motion`, `mi-draft-declaration`
- Filing court: `mi-wayne`, `mi-oakland`, `mi-36th-district`,
  `mi-circuit-courts`, `mi-district-courts`
- Deadline arithmetic: `mi-deadlines`; default vacatur: `mi-post-judgment`
- Matter-specific defenses: `mi-consumer-debt`, `mi-family-law`,
  `mi-landlord-tenant`, `mi-personal-injury`, `mi-employment`
