# Draft a Michigan Motion

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** This skill scaffolds a draft motion as a
> drafting aid. The user — not the skill — chooses the motion
> type, the theory of relief, and the strategy. Verify every
> rule, deadline, and citation against the current Michigan Court
> Rules and controlling case law before filing.

Use this skill to produce a **motion + notice of hearing +
supporting brief** in Michigan format. The form and content of
motions is governed by **MCR 2.119**. The caption, signature
block (with the attorney's State Bar **P-number**), and proof of
service follow `mi-statewide-format`.

## MCR 2.119 — form and content of motions

**MCR 2.119(A)** governs the motion itself:

- **MCR 2.119(A)(1)** — a motion must be in writing (unless made
  during a hearing or trial), state with particularity the grounds
  and authority on which it is based, and state the relief or
  order sought.
- **MCR 2.119(A)(2)** — a **separate brief** supporting a motion
  or response is **required** for certain motions (notably motions
  brought under MCR 2.116 — summary disposition), and the brief
  must be filed and served with the motion or response. For other
  motions a brief may be filed but is not required. Verify the
  current text of MCR 2.119(A)(2) for which motion types require
  the separate brief.
- **MCR 2.119(A)(3)** — a motion or response that presents an
  issue of fact must be supported by an **affidavit** or other
  evidence (see `mi-draft-declaration`).

**MCR 2.119(C)** sets the timing for serving and filing a written
motion and any response (the standard notice period and the
response deadline) — confirm the current periods and compute the
dates with `mi-deadlines`.

**MCR 2.119(E)** addresses hearings on motions and when a court
may dispense with oral argument.

## Page limits and typography

Michigan does not set a single universal motion page limit in MCR
2.119; **page limits, line spacing, and chambers-copy or
courtesy-copy requirements are commonly set by LOCAL court rules
(LCR) and the assigned judge's practice guidelines**. Check the
local rules of the filing court and the judge's standing orders
before finalizing. Do not hard-code a page count here — see
`mi-statewide-format` and the venue overlay, and consult
`mi-law-references` for the corpus of court rules.

## Summary disposition — MCR 2.116 and the *Maiden* standard

The most common dispositive motion in Michigan is the **motion for
summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)**, with the ground
identified by subrule:

- **MCR 2.116(C)(7)** — the claim is barred (e.g., release, prior
  judgment, statute of limitations, immunity, prior pending
  action). The court considers the pleadings plus any affidavits,
  depositions, admissions, or documentary evidence; well-pleaded
  factual allegations are accepted as true unless contradicted by
  the documentary evidence.
- **MCR 2.116(C)(8)** — failure to state a claim on which relief
  can be granted. Tested on the **pleadings alone**; the motion is
  granted only if the claim is so clearly unenforceable that no
  factual development could justify recovery.
- **MCR 2.116(C)(10)** — no genuine issue of material fact and the
  moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Tested
  on the pleadings **and the documentary evidence** submitted; the
  evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving
  party.

The governing standard is set out in **Maiden v Rozwood, 461 Mich
109; 597 NW2d 817 (1999)** (verify the citation and the current
case law refining it before relying on it). *Maiden* describes the
distinct evidentiary tests for (C)(8) vs. (C)(10): a (C)(8) motion
is decided on the pleadings, while a (C)(10) motion requires the
court to consider the substantively admissible evidence and,
where the moving party meets its initial burden, shifts to the
nonmovant to set forth specific facts showing a genuine issue for
trial — the nonmovant may not rest on mere allegations.

> A (C)(10) motion is typically accompanied by supporting
> **affidavits** and documentary exhibits (see
> `mi-draft-declaration`); MCR 2.116(G) governs the supporting and
> opposing materials and the timing. Confirm the current subrule
> text.

## Common motion types

| Motion | Rule | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Motion for Summary Disposition | MCR 2.116(C)(7)/(8)/(10) | *Maiden* standard; separate brief required (MCR 2.119(A)(2)); (C)(8) on pleadings, (C)(10) on evidence |
| Motion to Compel Discovery | MCR 2.313 | Attach the deficient responses; check the local-rule meet-and-confer / concurrence requirement |
| Motion for Reconsideration | MCR 2.119(F) | Within **21 days** of the order; must show palpable error (verify current text) |
| Motion for Relief from Judgment | MCR 2.612 | Mistake, newly discovered evidence, fraud, void judgment, etc. |
| Motion in Limine | (inherent / MRE) | Pre-trial; anticipated evidentiary disputes |

## The pro-se drafting framework — applied to motions

Self-represented filers should follow the **pro-se drafting
framework** (see `mi-pro-se`):

1. **State the relief clearly** in the opening sentence.
2. **Cite the rule** (MCR ____) that grants the court power to
   award that relief, with particularity per MCR 2.119(A)(1).
3. **State the facts** that satisfy each element of the standard,
   with record citations to a supporting affidavit.
4. **Apply the controlling Michigan case law** to those facts.
5. **Conclude** with the specific order sought, and attach a
   proposed Order (see `mi-draft-order`).
