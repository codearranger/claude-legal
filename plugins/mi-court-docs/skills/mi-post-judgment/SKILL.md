# Michigan Post-Judgment Procedure

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** This skill addresses procedure once a Michigan
> judgment has been entered. Verify every step — and every dollar
> figure and day count — against current law before filing or
> responding.

Use this skill alongside `mi-statewide-format` when the case is **past
judgment** — whether you are attacking the judgment, defending against
collection, or collecting on it.

## Two paths after judgment

1. **Attack the judgment** — post-trial motions (MCR 2.610-2.611),
   reconsideration (MCR 2.119(F)), or relief from judgment (MCR 2.612).
2. **Collect or resist collection** — garnishment (MCR 3.101),
   execution (MCR 3.106), judgment liens (MCL 600.2801 et seq.),
   creditor's examination (MCR 2.621), installment-payment orders (MCL
   600.6201 et seq.), exemptions (MCL 600.6023), and satisfaction.

## Attacking the judgment

### New trial / amend / JNOV — MCR 2.610-2.611

After trial, move for a **new trial** under **MCR 2.611** (grounds:
irregularity, jury misconduct, excessive/inadequate damages, verdict
against the great weight of the evidence, legal error). **JNOV** or a
motion to **amend the judgment** runs under **MCR 2.610**.

> ⚠ **Timing.** A motion for new trial or to amend the judgment is due
> **21 days after entry** (MCR 2.611(B) / MCR 2.610(A)). A motion for
> **reconsideration** under **MCR 2.119(F)** is also due within **21
> days** of entry of the order. Confirm the current day counts in the
> corpus; calendar them at entry — see `mi-deadlines`.

### Reconsideration — MCR 2.119(F)

The standard under **MCR 2.119(F)(3)** is demanding: show a **"palpable
error"** by which the court and parties were misled **and** that a
different disposition must result. A motion that merely re-presents the
same issues already ruled on will not be granted. Verify the rule text.

### Relief from judgment — MCR 2.612

**MCR 2.612** is Michigan's FRCP-60 analog. Grounds under **MCR
2.612(C)(1)**: (a) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect; (b) newly discovered evidence; (c) fraud, misrepresentation, or
other misconduct of an adverse party; (d) the judgment is **void**; (e)
satisfied/released or no longer equitable to apply prospectively; (f)
any other reason justifying relief.

> **Timing.** A 2.612 motion must be made within a **reasonable time**,
> and for grounds **(a)-(c)** **not more than one year** after entry
> (MCR 2.612(C)(2)). Confirm the reasonable-time case law.

- **Setting aside a default / default judgment** is the most common use,
  especially in consumer debt-buyer cases with defective service. **MCR
  2.603(D)** generally requires both **good cause** and a **verified
  statement of facts showing a meritorious defense** (a lack-of-
  jurisdiction / bad-service attack does not need the meritorious-defense
  showing). Pair with the
  substantive defense — chain of title, SOL — see `mi-consumer-debt`.

## Collecting / resisting collection

### Writ of garnishment — MCR 3.101 / MCL 600.4011 et seq.

A money judgment reaches funds held by a third party (garnishee) via a
**writ of garnishment** under **MCR 3.101** / **MCL 600.4011 et seq.**:

- **Periodic** garnishment reaches **wages** and other periodic
  payments — writ on form **MC 12**, garnishee answers on the **MC 13**
  disclosure.
- **Non-periodic** garnishment reaches a single obligation (**bank
  account**, tax refund).

> **Process.** Plaintiff files the writ; the clerk issues it; it is
> served on the garnishee with a copy to the defendant. The garnishee
> files the **MC 13 disclosure** within the rule's period; the defendant
> may file **objections** within the time on the writ. **Verify the
> current service mechanics, disclosure deadline, and objection window**
> in the corpus. The federal CCPA garnishment cap (15 U.S.C.
> §§ 1671-1677) sets a wage-protection floor in Michigan.

### Execution and judgment liens

- **Writ of execution — MCR 3.106 / MCL 600.6001 et seq.**: directs a
  court officer/sheriff to levy on and sell the debtor's **non-exempt**
  property to satisfy the judgment.
- **Judgment liens — MCL 600.2801 et seq.**: record a notice of
  judgment lien against the debtor's **real property** with the register
  of deeds. Note the statutory **homestead carve-out** and the lien
  **duration / renewal** rules — verify the current term in the corpus.

### Creditor's examination — MCR 2.621

To **locate assets**, **MCR 2.621** authorizes post-judgment discovery
and a **creditor's examination** compelling the debtor (or a third
party) to answer under oath about income, property, and accounts.
Failure to appear can expose the debtor to **contempt**.

### Installment-payment orders — MCL 600.6201 et seq.

The court may order the debtor to pay the judgment in **installments**
under **MCL 600.6201 et seq.** A compliant installment order can **bar
concurrent wage garnishment** — verify the current interplay in the
corpus.

### Exemptions from execution — MCL 600.6023

A debtor may protect property through statutory **exemptions**,
principally **MCL 600.6023** (plus related Code and federal provisions):

- **Personal-property** exemptions (household goods, tools of the trade,
  motor-vehicle value) under MCL 600.6023.
- A **homestead** exemption in the residence.
- **Head-of-household / wage** protection (with the CCPA federal floor).
- Categorically protected funds — **Social Security** (42 U.S.C. § 407),
  certain public benefits and retirement accounts.
- The **federal-vs-state exemption choice** where the matter touches
  bankruptcy; confirm the current rule.

> ⚠ **Do not rely on an exemption dollar amount from memory.** Michigan's
> MCL 600.6023 figures (and homestead/wage amounts) are set and
> periodically **adjusted / inflation-indexed by statute**. **Look up
> the current MCL 600.6023 amounts** before asserting them.

To claim an exemption, the debtor files the written **objection / claim
of exemption** with the issuing court within the period the garnishment
papers specify; the court then resolves it. Confirm the current
procedure and deadline — act promptly. See `mi-deadlines`.

### Satisfaction of judgment

When a judgment is paid in full, the **satisfaction** should be entered
of record. The creditor ordinarily files a **satisfaction of judgment**
and discharges any recorded judgment lien; if the creditor refuses after
payment, the debtor may move the court to enter satisfaction with proof.
Verify any statutory penalty for failure to enter satisfaction after
demand.

## Common pro se scenarios

1. **Debt-buyer default judgment** — MCR 2.612 (and MCR 2.603(D)) motion
   to set aside on defective service / excusable neglect plus a
   meritorious defense (chain of title, SOL). See `mi-consumer-debt`.
2. **Bank account holding Social Security garnished** — assert the 42
   U.S.C. § 407 exemption and any MCL 600.6023 exemption; file the
   objection within the writ's window.
3. **Wage garnishment** — confirm withholding is within the CCPA cap,
   check the current MCL 600.6023 / head-of-household protection, and
   consider an installment order (MCL 600.6201) to bar it.
4. **Creditor demands a debtor exam** — respond under MCR 2.621; appear
   and answer to avoid contempt.
