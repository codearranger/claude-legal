# Assemble a Michigan Court Filing Packet

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** This skill walks through filing mechanics.
> Verify the e-filing platform, document types, fees, and pro-se
> acceptance with the filing court's clerk before submitting.

Use this skill when ready to **submit** a Michigan trial-court
filing. First determine the **filing channel** for the venue, then
assemble and preflight the multi-document packet.

## Michigan e-filing — MiFILE / MiCOURT (TrueFiling)

Michigan's statewide e-filing system is **MiFILE**, built on the
Tyler Technologies **TrueFiling** platform and reached through the
**MiCOURT** portal. E-filing is governed by **MCR 1.109(G)**
(electronic filing and electronic service).

E-filing has been rolling out **court by court**, and is
**mandatory in many courts** for many case types — but not every
court or case type is live. Before assuming the channel, confirm
for the specific court:

1. **Whether MiFILE / TrueFiling is live** in that court; and
2. **Whether e-filing is mandatory** for the case type, or paper is
   still accepted.

Where the court is not yet on MiFILE, file on **paper** at the
clerk's window (see below).

## E-filing workflow (MiFILE / TrueFiling)

The TrueFiling shape is consistent across courts:

1. Register / log in to a MiFILE account through the MiCOURT portal
2. Search for the case by case number or party name (or start a new
   case for an initial filing)
3. Select the court, case type, and the **filing / document type**
   for each component
4. Upload each component as a **separate PDF** (text-searchable;
   verify any bookmark / size requirements for long filings)
5. Pay any filing fee, or attach the **MC 20** fee-waiver request
6. Submit; the system returns a file-stamp / acceptance confirmation
   and effects electronic service on registered parties

## Paper filing (courts not on MiFILE)

Where e-filing is unavailable, bring clean copies to the clerk's
window during business hours; the clerk file-stamps the original and
returns a stamped copy. Confirm whether the court accepts mail or
drop-box filings, and how many copies (judge's copy / conformed
copy) the court wants.

## Multi-document packet — typical components

A standard Michigan motion packet consists of these documents:

| # | Document | Authority / note |
|---|----------|------|
| 1 | Motion | MCR 2.119 |
| 2 | Brief in support (if used) | MCR 2.119(A)(2); page limits are local |
| 3 | Notice of Hearing | MCR 2.119(C) notice period; see `mi-schedule-hearing` |
| 4 | Supporting affidavit (sworn) | MCR 2.119(B); MRE 803(6) records foundation |
| 5 | Exhibits | Attach written instruments referenced in the motion |
| 6 | Proposed Order | Submitted with the motion; see `mi-submit-order` |
| 7 | Proof of Service | MCR 2.107(D) — date, method, recipients |

Choose the closest matching document-type label in the TrueFiling
menu; the menus vary by court and case type.

## Personal identifying information — MCR 1.109(D)(9)

Michigan **protects personal identifying information** in court
filings under **MCR 1.109(D)(9)**. Before filing, review every
component (including exhibits) and handle protected PII as the rule
requires — generally by **excluding or partially redacting** items
such as Social Security / financial-account numbers and similar
identifiers, and using the **MC 97 / MC 97a** addendum mechanism
where the protected data must be supplied to the court but kept out
of the public filing.

> Verify the exact subrule text and the current MC 97-series
> procedure against `mi-law-references` — the precise list of
> protected identifiers and the partial-redaction format are set by
> rule, and the filing court may have additional requirements.

The redacting party is responsible for the redaction; the clerk does
not redact for you.

## Preflight — run the helper scripts

Before assembling the packet:

```
# Format / MCR 1.109 caption + form check
python3 plugins/mi-court-docs/scripts/format-check.py path/to/filing.docx

# Deadline arithmetic — MCR 1.108 computation, MCR 2.107(C) service
# add-ons, with Michigan court-holiday handling
python3 plugins/mi-court-docs/scripts/case-calendar.py ...
```

Use `case-calendar.py` to confirm the motion's hearing is noticed
with the required lead time under **MCR 2.119(C)** and to compute any
response deadline with the applicable service add-on.

## Filing fees

Filing fees are set by statute and the clerk's fee schedule and vary
by court and case type. **Confirm the current amount with the filing
court's clerk** before submitting; do not hard-code a figure. Pay by
the platform's accepted method (card / e-check) or at the clerk's
cashier window for paper filings.

### Fee waiver — MC 20

A filer who cannot afford the fees may request a waiver by filing the
**MC 20** (Fee Waiver Request / affidavit and order suspending fees)
with the first filing — do not pay and seek a refund later. The court
reviews the request and enters an order granting, denying, or
deferring fees. Verify the current MC 20 form and eligibility
standard with the clerk. See `mi-pro-se`.

## Filing vs. service — two distinct steps

Filing with the court is **not** the same as serving the opposing
party:

1. **Filing** — through MiFILE / TrueFiling or at the clerk's window.
2. **Service of process** (initial summons + complaint) — under
   **MCR 2.105**, with the summons issued under **MCR 2.102** and its
   life / return governed by that rule (verify the current summons
   validity period).
3. **Service of subsequent papers** (motions, notices, orders) —
   under **MCR 2.107**, on every party by an allowed method;
   document it in the **Proof of Service** under MCR 2.107(D). Add
   the applicable service period under **MCR 2.107(C)** when service
   is by mail or other non-personal method.

If MiFILE performs electronic service on registered parties under
MCR 1.109(G) / MCR 2.107(C)(4), a party without an e-filing account
must still be served by another allowed MCR 2.107 method — confirm
the platform's e-service coverage for each party.
