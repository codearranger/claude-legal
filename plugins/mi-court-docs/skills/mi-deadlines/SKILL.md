# Michigan Case Deadlines

> rules and any standing or scheduling order, and treat no computed
> date as final without checking.

Use this skill to compute deadlines under **MCR 1.108** (time
computation), the Michigan legal-holiday list (**MCL 435.101**), and
the named rules across the Michigan Court Rules and the Revised
Judicature Act. The arithmetic lives in `scripts/case-calendar.py`;
this body is the framework and the pointer to authority.

## MCR 1.108 — computation of time

To count a period stated in days in the Michigan Court Rules, a court
order, or (unless otherwise provided) a statute:

1. **Exclude** the day of the act, event, or default that begins the
   period (e.g., the date of service).
2. **Include** the last day of the period, **unless** it is a
   **Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday** (or a day the court is
   closed by order) — in which case the period runs to the **end of
   the next day** that is none of those.
3. For periods stated in **weeks, months, or years**, MCR 1.108 fixes
   the ending date by the corresponding calendar unit (e.g., the
   anniversary date for a year); compute these on the calendar, not as
   a fixed day count.

> Frame every day count below as the **current** rule. Confirm the
> number against the verbatim rule text in `mi-law-references` before
> treating any computed date as final.

### MCR 2.107(C) — the mail / e-service add-on

When a period runs from **service** of a paper and service was made by
**mail**, Michigan adds time to the prescribed period. Apply the
add-on **after** the underlying MCR 1.108 count, and confirm the
current number of days and the treatment of **electronic service**
under MCR 2.107(C) in `mi-law-references` — the add-on and the
e-service rules are amended periodically.

## Michigan legal holidays — MCL 435.101

The holidays that trigger the MCR 1.108 roll-forward come from **MCL
435.101**. The list below is qualitative; the **authoritative,
year-by-year computed set lives in `scripts/case-calendar.py` and the
corpus** — confirm there before relying on a date.

| Holiday | Date rule |
|---|---|
| New Year's Day | January 1 (fixed) |
| Martin Luther King, Jr. Day | 3rd Monday in January |
| **Lincoln's Birthday** | **February 12 (fixed)** — Michigan **does** observe |
| Washington's Birthday (Presidents' Day) | 3rd Monday in February |
| Memorial / Decoration Day | Last Monday in May |
| Juneteenth | June 19 (fixed) |
| Independence Day | July 4 (fixed) |
| Labor Day | 1st Monday in September |
| Columbus Day | 2nd Monday in October |
| Veterans' Day | November 11 (fixed) |
| Thanksgiving | 4th Thursday in November |
| Day after Thanksgiving | Friday after the 4th Thursday in November |
| Christmas | December 25 (fixed) |

> **Michigan specific to flag.** MCL 435.101 **includes Lincoln's
> Birthday (February 12)** and a **day-after-Thanksgiving** holiday —
> both uncommon among the states and both count for the MCR 1.108
> roll-forward. Sundays are treated as holidays for these purposes.

> **Substitution.** When a fixed-date holiday falls on a weekend,
> confirm the observed day in the corpus / script rather than assuming
> a Friday or Monday observance.

## Named rules — quick reference

Run `python3 scripts/case-calendar.py --rules` for the full list. The
most commonly invoked:

| Rule key | Days | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| `answer-due-personal` | +21 | MCR 2.108(A)(1) (personal service of summons + complaint) |
| `answer-due-mail` | +28 | MCR 2.108(A)(2) (served by mail or served outside Michigan) |
| `motion-response` | per MCR 2.119 | MCR 2.119(C) (response / hearing-notice timing) |
| `motion-reconsideration` | +21 | MCR 2.119(F) (after entry of the order) |
| `mail-add-on` | per rule | MCR 2.107(C) (service by mail) |
| `claim-of-appeal` | +21 / +14 | MCR 7.204(A) (period varies by trigger — verify which applies) |
| `sol-contract` | see corpus | MCL 600.5807 |
| `sol-injury-property` | see corpus | MCL 600.5805 |
| `sol-malpractice` | see corpus | MCL 600.5805 / 600.5838a |

The script encodes the day counts and the holiday roll-forward; always
confirm an unusual number against the cited rule. **Answer deadlines
(MCR 2.108) are stable enough to state in this body; statute-of-
limitations day counts are not — cite the MCL section and read the
current period from the corpus.**

## Answer deadlines — MCR 2.108

These are the load-bearing first-response numbers and are stable:

- **21 days** after **personal service** of the summons and complaint
  (MCR 2.108(A)(1)).
- **28 days** when the defendant was **served by mail** or **served
  outside Michigan** (MCR 2.108(A)(2)).

A timely pre-answer motion under MCR 2.116 alters the time to file a
responsive pleading — see `mi-first-30-days`. Motion practice timing
(notice of hearing, response, reply) is governed by **MCR 2.119**;
read the current intervals from `mi-law-references`.

## Statutes of limitations — point at the RJA, do not embed counts

Michigan's civil limitations periods live in the **Revised Judicature
Act at MCL 600.5801–600.5839**. **Cite the section and read the current
period from the corpus** rather than hard-coding a count here (these
drift and are claim-specific):

| Claim family | Authority |
|---|---|
| Injury to person or property; general tort (incl. shorter periods for certain intentional torts) | MCL 600.5805 |
| Contract (incl. most account / credit; UCC goods periods may displace) | MCL 600.5807 |
| Medical / professional malpractice (with the discovery overlay) | MCL 600.5805 / 600.5838a |
| Real-property / recovery of land | MCL 600.5801 |

SOL **accrual, tolling, and any revival** (by acknowledgment or
part-payment) are **fact-dependent** — verify against current law for
the specific claim. Periods stated in **years** are computed on the
calendar (anniversary) date, not as a fixed day count.

## Appeal and post-judgment windows to watch

- **Motion for reconsideration — MCR 2.119(F).** File within **21
  days** after entry of the order. See `mi-post-judgment`.
- **Claim of appeal to the Court of Appeals — MCR 7.204(A).** The
  appeal period is **21 days** for most final judgments/orders and
  **14 days** for certain triggers; **confirm which period applies**
  to the specific order. See `mi-post-judgment`.

## How `mi-deadlines` composes with the scripts

The body above is the reference; the arithmetic lives in
`scripts/case-calendar.py`, which encodes the **MCL 435.101** holidays
(including **Lincoln's Birthday** and the **day after Thanksgiving**)
and the set for any year, applies the MCR 1.108 roll-forward off
Saturdays / Sundays / holidays and the MCR 2.107(C) mail add-on, and
maps named rule keys to `(days, description, authority)`. Run:

```
python3 scripts/case-calendar.py --rules                      # list rule keys
python3 scripts/case-calendar.py --from 2025-03-14 --rule answer-due-personal
```

Confirm the script's holiday set and rule counts against
`mi-law-references` after any quarterly corpus refresh.

## Composition

- For format: `mi-statewide-format`
- For the substantive rule or statute text: `mi-law-references`
- For first-response timing: `mi-first-30-days`
- For discovery timing: `mi-discovery`
- For post-judgment / appeal timing: `mi-post-judgment`
- For matter-specific deadlines: `mi-family-law`, `mi-consumer-debt`,
  `mi-personal-injury`, `mi-landlord-tenant`
