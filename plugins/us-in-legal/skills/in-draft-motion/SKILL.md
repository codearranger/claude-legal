# Draft an Indiana Motion (with Memorandum of Law)

This is the scaffolder for any motion filed in an Indiana civil
court. It produces a four-document packet:

1. **Motion** — the operative request for relief
2. **Memorandum in Support** — the legal argument
3. **Declaration (or Affidavit)** — any sworn factual predicate
4. **Proposed Order** — the order the judge will sign if granted

Marion CPC § II.A and most Indiana county local rules require a
proposed order to accompany any motion. The court typically will
not rule without one.

> verify each cited rule, statute, and case against current
> sources before filing.

## Motion structure — Trial Rule 7(B)

T.R. 7(B) requires every motion to:

- State the relief sought "with particularity"
- State the grounds for the relief

Indiana practice splits the motion into two documents: the
**Motion** itself (1-3 pages, stating the request and grounds)
and a **Memorandum in Support** (longer, with the legal argument
and case law). This is the convention even though T.R. 7 does not
strictly require separation.

## Page limits

Indiana does NOT set statewide page limits on memoranda. Local
practice:

- **Marion Civil Division (LR49-TR5-203)**: chambers-copy
  threshold at 15 pages, but no hard cap. Most motions stay
  under 15 pages by convention.
- **Lake County (LR45-TR5)**: chambers-copy threshold at 20
  pages.
- **Hamilton County (LR29-TR5)**: chambers-copy threshold at 15
  pages.
- Other counties: typically 15-25 pages by local convention.

For motions exceeding the chambers-copy threshold, follow the
chambers-copy delivery protocol in the venue skill (e.g.,
`in-marion` § "Chambers copies — when and how").

## Motion types — pattern variations

### T.R. 12(B)(6) — Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim

- Title: "DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS UNDER TRIAL RULE
  12(B)(6)"
- Standard: accept all well-pleaded allegations as true; ask
  whether under any conceivable set of facts the plaintiff would
  be entitled to relief (*Trail v. Boys & Girls Clubs of
  Northwest Ind.*, 845 N.E.2d 130 (Ind. 2006))
- No need for declaration — confined to the four corners of the
  Complaint
- Outside-the-pleadings exhibits will convert the motion to T.R.
  56 (summary judgment)

### T.R. 56 — Motion for Summary Judgment

- Title: "DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT"
- **Critical Indiana-specific point**: Indiana applies the
  *Jarboe* burden — the movant must AFFIRMATIVELY NEGATE an
  element with admissible evidence, not just point to absence of
  evidence in the record. *Jarboe v. Landmark Cmty. Newspapers*,
  644 N.E.2d 118 (Ind. 1994); reaffirmed *Hughley v. State*, 15
  N.E.3d 1000 (Ind. 2014).
- Indiana **rejected** the federal *Celotex* "show the absence
  of evidence" approach.
- Must include a "Statement of Material Facts Not in Genuine
  Dispute" with paragraph-numbered facts, each citing a sworn
  declaration or exhibit (T.R. 56(C)).
- Response deadline: 30 days from service of motion (T.R.
  56(C)).
- Hearing: usually within 60 days; the court must hold a hearing
  if requested (T.R. 56(C)).

### T.R. 37(A) — Motion to Compel

- Title: "DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR
  PRODUCTION"
- Must include T.R. 37(E) meet-and-confer certificate
- Recite each unanswered discovery request with the alleged
  defect

### T.R. 60(B) — Motion for Relief from Judgment

- Title: "DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT UNDER
  TRIAL RULE 60(B)(1)"
- Required showing: (1) excusable neglect or other T.R. 60(B)
  ground + (2) meritorious defense
- Filed in the trial court (not the Court of Appeals)
- Outer deadline: 1 year for grounds (1), (2), (3); "reasonable
  time" for (4)-(8)

### T.R. 59 — Motion to Correct Error

- Title: "DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO CORRECT ERROR (TRIAL RULE 59)"
- **30-day jurisdictional deadline from final judgment**
- Must state with specificity the alleged errors
- Court has 45 days to rule (T.R. 59(B)) or motion is deemed
  denied

## Verification — when required

Most motions do NOT require a verified motion. Exceptions:

- T.R. 65 preliminary injunction (verified petition)
- IC 34-26-5 protective order petition
- T.R. 69 proceedings supplemental motion
- T.R. 12(B)(2) lack of personal jurisdiction (when challenging
  the affidavit of service)

For verified motions, the signer affirms under penalties for
perjury per IC 35-44.1-2-1: "I affirm, under the penalties for
perjury, that the foregoing representations are true."

## Composition

- `in-statewide-format` for T.R. 5(E) format + T.R. 10 caption
- `in-marion` / `in-lake` / `in-county-courts` for venue + local
  rules
- `in-pro-se` for self-represented signature block
- `in-draft-declaration` for the supporting declaration
- `in-draft-order` for the proposed order
- `in-fact-check` for the pre-filing citation audit
- `in-quality-check` for the final QC

## References

- `references/motion-template.md` — full motion + memo + decl +
  order packet for a T.R. 12(B)(6) motion
- `references/sj-template.md` — T.R. 56 summary judgment packet
  with Jarboe burden language
- `references/motion-to-compel-template.md` — T.R. 37(A) packet
  with meet-and-confer certificate
- `references/tr60-motion-template.md` — T.R. 60(B)(1) motion
