# Indiana County Courts (Roll-Up: All Counties Other Than Marion + Lake)

This skill covers Indiana's other 90 counties — the most-populous
counties by civil docket are detailed below, and the long tail is
served by the statewide directory. Indiana has **92 counties**,
each with its own Circuit Court (IC 33-28) and most also have one
or more Superior Courts (IC 33-29). Most counties have
**concurrent civil jurisdiction** between the Circuit Court and
the Superior Court(s); the Circuit Court has the constitutionally
guaranteed jurisdiction (Ind. Const. art. 7, § 8) and the
Superior Court is statutory (IC 33-29-1-1).

## Circuit vs. Superior Court — what's the difference?

**Functionally, very little** in most counties. Both courts have:

- Civil jurisdiction over the same dollar amounts (no monetary
  ceiling in the Circuit Court; no monetary floor in most Superior
  Courts)
- Criminal jurisdiction (Class C/D felonies and misdemeanors in
  most Superior Courts; full felony jurisdiction in Circuit
  Courts)
- Probate, juvenile, family-law jurisdiction (varies by county
  rule)

The historical distinction:

- **Circuit Courts** are constitutional; every county has exactly
  one Circuit Court with one elected judge.
- **Superior Courts** are statutory; counties with sufficient
  population get one or more Superior Courts to handle overflow.

**Cause-number prefix** identifies which:

- `[CC]C01` = Circuit Court of that county (e.g., `49C01` = Marion
  Circuit; `02C01` = Allen Circuit; `71C01` = St. Joseph Circuit)
- `[CC]D01`, `D02`, ... = Superior Court Divisions (e.g., `02D02`
  = Allen Superior Court 2; `71D01` = St. Joseph Superior 1)

The Indiana county code map is on the Indiana Supreme Court's
website; the first two digits of every cause number identify the
county (`01` Adams, `02` Allen, `03` Bartholomew, ..., `92`
Whitley).

## Long-tail counties — accessing local rules

For counties not in the table above, look up the cause-number
prefix on the Indiana Supreme Court website
(`courts.in.gov/forms-and-publications/court-orders/local-court-
rules`). Every county publishes its local rule set as a single
PDF.

Common features across long-tail counties:

- **Single Circuit Court Judge** in many smaller counties (e.g.,
  Crawford, Switzerland, Ohio, Owen) — the same judge hears
  civil, criminal, probate, and family cases
- **Concurrent Circuit + Superior Court jurisdiction** — pleadings
  may name the Circuit Court if uncertain; the case may be
  transferred under IC 33-29-1-9
- **Mandatory Odyssey e-filing** is now statewide (effective
  June 2018); the only paper filings accepted are pro se filings
  under the Indiana Administrative Rule 16 carve-out

## Statewide directory (all 92 counties)

The full 92-county directory (county code, courts, addresses,
clerk phone, local-rule PDF link) lives in
`references/county-directory.md`. The directory is sorted
alphabetically and includes population, judicial district, and
notable practice quirks.

for Court of Appeals review (Ind. App. Rule 1 — appellate
districts):

- **District 1** (Southeast): includes Marion, Dearborn, Shelby,
