# Lake Superior Court — Crown Point / Hammond / East Chicago

Lake Superior Court is Indiana's **second-largest trial court** by
civil docket — sited in the northwest corner of the state along
the Calumet region and serving the Gary / Hammond / Merrillville
population center. The court is constituted under IC 33-33-45 and
operates from three primary courthouse complexes:

- **Lake County Government Center**, 2293 N. Main Street, Crown
  Point, IN 46307 — primary civil and criminal courthouse for
  Civil Divisions 1, 2, 3, and 4
- **Hammond Superior Court (East Chicago Division)**, 232 Russell
  Street, Hammond, IN 46320 — Civil Division 5 and limited
  criminal docket
- **East Chicago Superior Court**, 3711 Main Street, East
  Chicago, IN 46312 — minor civil and ordinance violations

The **Lake Circuit Court** is constituted separately under IC
33-33-45-1 and sits in Crown Point at the County Government
Center; the Circuit Court has overlapping civil jurisdiction with
the Superior Court (most Indiana counties have this dual structure
— see `in-county-courts`).

## Case assignment — by division and case type

Lake Superior Court assigns civil cases by **case-type code** and
random rotation across the Civil Division courts. The cause
number structure:

`45D01-2504-PL-000567`

Parsing:
- `45` — Lake County
- `D01` — Superior Court, Division 1 (Crown Point Civil 1)
- `2504` — April 2025 filing
- `PL` — Plaintiff (civil plenary)
- `000567` — sequence number

Division taxonomy:

| Cause prefix | Court | Location |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| `45C01` | Lake Circuit Court | Crown Point |
| `45D01` | Lake Superior Court, Civil Division 1 | Crown Point |
| `45D02` | Lake Superior Court, Civil Division 2 | Crown Point |
| `45D03` | Lake Superior Court, Civil Division 3 | Crown Point |
| `45D04` | Lake Superior Court, Civil Division 4 | Crown Point |
| `45D05` | Lake Superior Court, Civil Division 5 | Hammond |
| `45D11` | Lake Superior Court, County Division 1 (small claims) | Crown Point |
| `45D12` | Lake Superior Court, County Division 2 (Hammond) | Hammond |
| `45D13` | Lake Superior Court, County Division 3 (Gary) | Gary |
| `45D14` | Lake Superior Court, County Division 4 (East Chicago) | East Chicago |

The County Divisions (45D11-D14) carry the small-claims and
ordinance-violation dockets under IC 33-29-2; civil claims up to
$10,000 file there, while claims above $10,000 go to a Civil
Division.

## Lake County Local Rules (LR45)

Lake adopts local rules with the prefix `LR45`. Highlights:

| Rule | Subject |
|------|---------|
| LR45-TR3.1 | Appearance form |
| LR45-TR5 | Format of documents; chambers copies for filings over 20 pages |
| LR45-TR16 | Pretrial procedure; CMS template |
| LR45-TR40 | Trial setting and continuances |
| LR45-TR53.5 | Continuances — requires written motion, no oral motions |
| LR45-TR65 | Preliminary injunction — verified petition required |
| LR45-TR79 | Special judges; selection from Lake County panel |
| LR45-FL00 | Domestic Relations standing orders |
| LR45-AR1 | Court hours and holidays |

Compared to Marion: Lake's chambers-copy threshold is **20 pages**
(higher than Marion's 15) and the chambers copies must be
delivered to the assigned division's courtroom secretary, not the
judge directly.

## E-filing — Odyssey

Lake County adopted mandatory Odyssey e-filing for civil cases on
**July 1, 2017** (about six months after Marion). Same portal:
https://efile.courts.in.gov. Service Contacts and document codes
are identical to Marion.

Practical tips:

- Self-represented filers may e-file or paper-file. Paper filings
  are accepted at the Crown Point County Government Center
  Clerk's office Mon-Fri 8:30 AM - 4:30 PM.
- Filing fees: Lake's civil filing fee for a PL case is the
  statewide schedule under IC 33-37-4-4; verify the current Lake
  Clerk fee table.
- Document codes: identical to Marion's Odyssey schema.
- Hardcopy filings: paper filings still accepted from pro se
  filers under Indiana Administrative Rule 16 (the statewide
  e-filing rule's pro se carve-out).

## Civil case management — Lake Civil Divisions

Lake Civil Divisions do not have a unified CPC manual like Marion;
each division publishes its own case-management standing order on
the Lake Superior Court website (`lakecountyin.gov/superior-court`).
Common features across divisions:

- **Initial CMS**: due at the first status conference (typically
  60-90 days post-issue-joined)
- **Discovery cap**: T.R. 33(A)'s 25-interrogatory limit;
  Division 1 and Division 5 are stricter and require leave of
  court for any expansion
- **Motion practice**: motions submitted in writing under T.R. 7;
  oral argument requires a written request
- **Settlement conferences**: Lake divisions routinely set a
  mandatory settlement conference 60-90 days before trial

Lake Division 5 (Hammond) is the busiest division by case count
and runs the fastest docket; it has the shortest motion-decision
turnaround in the county.

## Township small-claims courts in Lake County

Lake County's small-claims docket runs through the **County
Divisions 11-14** (cause prefixes 45D11-D14) and is NOT a township
court. This differs from Marion County, where small-claims are
separate township courts. Lake's County Division clerks accept
small-claims complaints on a one-page Notice of Claim form
available on the Lake Superior Court website.

Jurisdictional caps and key features:

- Civil claims **up to $10,000** (IC 33-29-2-4)
- Trial de novo to Lake Superior Court Civil Division within 60
  days of judgment (IC 33-29-2-13)
- Bench trials only; no jury option
- Discovery limited; written discovery requires leave

## Composition — which skills layer here

- `in-statewide-format` for T.R. 5(E) / T.R. 10 baseline
- `in-pro-se` for self-represented filing in Lake
- `in-discovery` for T.R. 26-37 + Lake CMS interactions
- `in-deadlines` for T.R. 6 deadline math with Indiana legal
  holidays
- `in-schedule-hearing` for Lake-specific hearing setting
- `in-consumer-debt` if the case is a debt-collection action

## References

- `references/lr45-summary.md` — concise summary of every LR45
  rule
- `references/lake-divisions.md` — the 10 civil + county
  divisions with addresses and chambers contacts
