# Arizona — First 30 Days After Service

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Time is short. This skill helps a defendant
> sketch a response and surface the most important deadlines, but
> consult a licensed Arizona attorney about substantive defenses when
> possible.

Use this skill when the defendant has **just been served** with a civil
summons and complaint in an Arizona **Superior Court** (or a limited-
jurisdiction Justice Court — see `az-justice-courts`). It frames the
response window: the time in which the defendant must answer, move to
dismiss, or risk default.

## The clock — Ariz. R. Civ. P. 12(a)

| Event | Deadline | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Answer — served **within Arizona** | **20 days** after service | Ariz. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(1)(A)(i) |
| Answer — served **outside Arizona** | **30 days** after completion of service | Ariz. R. Civ. P. 4.2(m) |
| Answer to a counterclaim / cross-claim | **20 days** after service | Ariz. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(1)(B) |
| Responsive pleading after the court denies a Rule 12 motion | **10 days** after notice of the court's action | Ariz. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(2)(A) |

The **20-day / 30-day** split is the stable, statutory-style count.
Still confirm against the current Rule 12(a) (it sets several sub-
deadlines by service mode and posture) and compute the actual due date
with `az-deadlines` (Rule 6 time computation + the mail / service add-
ons). Verify all subsection numbers against the corpus before relying on
them.

> ⚠ **Default risk.** If the defendant neither answers nor moves within
> the window, the plaintiff may apply for **entry of default** under
> Rule 55(a) and then seek a **default judgment** under Rule 55(b).
> Setting a default aside later is hard — see the Rule 55 section below
> and `az-post-judgment`.

## Playbook

### Days 0-3 — read the complaint, check the summons

- **Read every numbered paragraph.** Note who is suing, on what claims,
  for what relief, and what contracts / accounts / events are alleged.
- **Note the court, county, and case number** — these go on every filing
  (`az-statewide-format` caption).
- **Check service** and the summons. Defective service / lack of personal
  jurisdiction is a defense — preserve it (Rule 12(b)(2), (4), (5); Rule
  12(h) waiver).
- **Note the court level**: Superior Court (general civil) vs. Justice
  Court (limited jurisdiction; confirm the cap via `az-justice-courts`).

### Days 3-10 — choose the response strategy

Three principal paths: (1) **Answer** under Rule 8 — admit, deny, or
plead lack of knowledge per paragraph (Rule 8(c)), state affirmative
defenses (Rule 8(d)), assert counterclaims (Rule 13); (2) **Motion to
Dismiss** under Rule 12(b), in lieu of an answer (grounds below); (3)
**Motion for a More Definite Statement** (Rule 12(e)) — disfavored.

> ⚠ **Plead affirmative defenses — Rule 8(d).** Arizona requires a party
> to **affirmatively state** any avoidance or affirmative defense in the
> responsive pleading; defenses omitted from the answer can be **waived**.
> This includes statute of limitations, release, payment, accord and
> satisfaction, statute of frauds, res judicata, and lack of standing /
> chain of title. **Plead all that may apply.** Verify Rule 8(d) and the
> waiver consequences before filing.

### Motion to dismiss — Rule 12(b)

The Rule 12(b) grounds, raised by motion before or with the answer:

| Subrule | Ground |
|---|---|
| **(b)(1)** | lack of subject-matter jurisdiction |
| **(b)(2)** | lack of personal jurisdiction |
| **(b)(3)** | improper venue |
| **(b)(4)** | insufficient process |
| **(b)(5)** | insufficient service of process |
| **(b)(6)** | **failure to state a claim** upon which relief can be granted |
| **(b)(7)** | failure to join a party under Rule 19 |

> **Rule 12(b)(6) — tested on the pleadings; conversion to Rule 56.** A
> 12(b)(6) motion tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint on the
> **pleadings alone**, accepting well-pleaded allegations as true. **If
> matters outside the pleadings are presented and not excluded, the
> motion is treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56** with a
> reasonable opportunity to present Rule 56 material (Rule 12(d) — verify
> the subsection). Do not attach evidence to a 12(b)(6) motion unless you
> intend conversion; if a fact dispute matters, move under Rule 56. The
> Arizona summary-judgment standard is *Orme School v. Reeves*, 166 Ariz.
> 301 (1990) — **verify the citation and holding**. SJ standards and
> timing live in `az-draft-motion`; this skill flags them at a pointer
> level.

> **Preserve the threatened defenses — Rule 12(h).** Lack of personal
> jurisdiction, improper venue, insufficient process, and insufficient
> service can be **waived** if not raised in the first Rule 12 motion or
> the answer. Raise them at the first opportunity; verify Rule 12(h).

> ⚠ **COMPULSORY ARBITRATION — Rules 72-77.** Arizona Superior Courts run
> a **mandatory (compulsory) arbitration program**. A civil case in which
> the amount in controversy does **not exceed the jurisdictional limit
> set by the county's Superior Court local rule** is **automatically
> assigned to a single arbitrator** and removed from the trial calendar
> until arbitration concludes — expect this for ordinary consumer-debt
> and small civil cases. Each party files a **certificate of compulsory
> arbitration** (or a controverting certificate) early in the case
> stating whether the case is subject to arbitration. An arbitration
> **award** may be **appealed for a trial de novo**, but an appealing
> party who fails to better its position can face cost / fee
> consequences. **Confirm your county's dollar threshold** and the
> certificate requirement via `az-law-references` and the local rule.
> This is a defining feature of Arizona civil practice — flag it for the
> client at the outset.

### Days 10-30 — draft the answer (or the motion)

#### Answer structure (Rule 8)

```
                              ANSWER,
                AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES, AND COUNTERCLAIM

   Defendant [Name] answers Plaintiff's Complaint as follows:

                              ANSWER
   1. Defendant admits the allegations in paragraph 1.
   2. Defendant denies the allegations in paragraph 2.
   3. Defendant lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a
      belief about the truth of paragraph 3, which has the effect of a
      denial.
   [...]

                       AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES
                   (Rule 8(d) — omission may waive)
   1. Plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations.
   2. Plaintiff lacks standing / chain of title to the alleged debt.
   3. [Release / payment / accord & satisfaction / statute of frauds /
      res judicata / failure to state a claim / etc.]

                            COUNTERCLAIM
   [If asserting one, plead it complaint-style with numbered factual
   allegations and named counts — Rule 13.]

                       DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL
   Defendant demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
```

#### Affirmative-defense catalog — Rule 8(d)

Plead **all** that may apply. Common Arizona defenses:

- Statute of limitations (very common — verify the period against
  `az-statutes-debt` / the relevant subject bundle)
- Payment / accord and satisfaction / release
- Discharge in bankruptcy
- Statute of frauds
- Estoppel / waiver / laches
- Failure of consideration / fraud / illegality
- Res judicata / collateral estoppel (prior judgment)
- Lack of standing / chain of title (debt-buyer cases — see
  `az-consumer-debt`)
- Failure to state a claim (Rule 12(b)(6))

### Counterclaims and cross-claims — Rule 13

- **Rule 13(a) — compulsory counterclaim.** A pleader must state any
  counterclaim against the opposing party arising out of the
  **transaction or occurrence** that is the subject of the opposing
  party's claim, or the claim may be **barred** in later litigation.
  Plead all known related counterclaims with the answer.
- **Rule 13(b)** — permissive counterclaim (unrelated claims); **cross-
  claims** against co-parties are also governed by Rule 13. Verify the
  current text and scope of the bar.

### Jury trial — Rule 38

**Arizona does not use the FRCP demand-or-waive model.** Under Rule
38(a), the right to a jury trial on any issue triable of right by a jury
is **preserved inviolate, and a party need not file a written demand or
take any other action to preserve it.** A jury right is **waived only by
an affirmative written stipulation signed by all parties who appear at
trial** (or an approved oral stipulation in open court), filed **no later
than 30 days before the trial** is scheduled to begin (Rule 38(b)).
Including a jury demand in the answer (above) is permissible belt-and-
suspenders practice but is not required to preserve the right; confirm
the current text of Rule 38.

### Entry of default and setting it aside — Rule 55

- **Rule 55(a) — application for entry of default.** The plaintiff files
  and serves an application; the default does **not** become effective
  immediately — the defendant has a short **cure window** (verify the
  current number of business days) to plead or otherwise defend. If the
  defendant pleads within it, default does not enter. **Treat an
  application for default as a hard signal to file the answer at once.**
- **Rule 55(b)** — default judgment entered after default is effective.
- **Rule 55(c)** — setting aside an entry of default for **good cause**.
- **Setting aside a default *judgment*** is governed by **Rule 60(b)/(c)**
  and is a demanding standard — not a fallback for missing the answer
  window. Vacatur is developed in `az-post-judgment`. Verify the Rule 55
  cure-window count and the Rule 60 grounds against the corpus.

## Filing the answer / motion

- **File** with the clerk of the Superior Court (or Justice Court) in the
  caption (confirm the e-filing platform — AZTurboCourt / county portal
  where mandated; otherwise paper).
- **Serve** all parties under Rule 5 with a certificate of service.
- **Sign** under Rule 11 (certifies the pleading is well-grounded;
  sanctions attach to violations).
- **File the certificate of compulsory arbitration** (Rules 72-77) where
  the county requires it.

## Composition

- Format / caption: `az-statewide-format`
- Drafting + the *Orme School* summary-judgment standard:
  `az-draft-motion`, `az-draft-declaration`
- Filing court: `az-maricopa`, `az-pima`, `az-superior-courts`,
  `az-justice-courts`
- Deadline arithmetic: `az-deadlines`; default vacatur: `az-post-judgment`
- Matter-specific defenses: `az-consumer-debt`, `az-family-law`,
  `az-landlord-tenant`, `az-personal-injury`, `az-employment`,
  `az-commercial-disputes`
