# Arizona Post-Judgment Procedure

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** This skill addresses procedure once an Arizona
> judgment has been entered. Verify every step — and every dollar figure
> and day count — against current law before filing or responding.

Use this skill alongside `az-statewide-format` when the case is **past
judgment** — whether you are attacking the judgment, defending against
collection, or collecting on it.

## Two paths after judgment

1. **Attack the judgment** — a motion for new trial or to alter/amend
   (Ariz. R. Civ. P. 59) or relief from judgment (Ariz. R. Civ. P. 60).
2. **Collect or resist collection** — garnishment (A.R.S. § 12-1598 et
   seq. earnings; § 12-1570 et seq. non-earnings), writ of execution
   (A.R.S. § 12-1551 et seq.), judgment liens (A.R.S. § 33-961 et seq.),
   debtor's examination, renewal (A.R.S. §§ 12-1611/-1612), exemptions
   (A.R.S. § 33-1101 / § 33-1121 et seq.), and satisfaction.

## Attacking the judgment

### New trial / alter or amend — Ariz. R. Civ. P. 59

After trial, move for a **new trial** under **Rule 59(a)** (grounds
include irregularity in the proceedings, jury or attorney misconduct,
excessive or insufficient damages, a verdict against the weight of the
evidence, newly discovered evidence, and error of law). A motion to
**alter or amend the judgment** runs under **Rule 59(d)**.

> ⚠ **Timing.** A Rule 59 motion for new trial or to alter or amend is
> due a fixed number of days **after entry of judgment**, and the window
> is **not extendable**. Confirm the current day count in the corpus and
> calendar it the moment judgment is entered — see `az-deadlines`.

### Relief from judgment — Ariz. R. Civ. P. 60

**Rule 60** is Arizona's FRCP-60 analog. Grounds under **Rule 60(b)**:
(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly
discovered evidence; (3) fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct
of an opposing party; (4) the judgment is **void**; (5)
satisfied/released or no longer equitable to apply prospectively; (6)
any other reason justifying relief. Rule 60(c) governs the timing of a
Rule 60(b) motion (see below); Rule 60(d) preserves other powers to
grant relief (e.g., independent actions, relief from a void judgment).

> **Timing.** A Rule 60(b) motion must be made within a **reasonable
> time**, and for grounds **(1)-(3)** **no more than the rule's outer
> limit** (a set number of days after entry). Confirm the current outer
> limit and the reasonable-time case law in the corpus.

- **Setting aside a default / default judgment** is the most common use,
  especially in consumer debt-buyer cases with defective service. A
  movant generally must show **good cause** and a **meritorious
  defense**; a void-for-defective-service attack (Rule 60(b)(4)) does
  not need the meritorious-defense showing. Pair with the substantive
  defense — chain of title, statute of limitations — see
  `az-consumer-debt`.

## Collecting / resisting collection

### Garnishment — earnings (A.R.S. § 12-1598 et seq.)

A judgment creditor reaches a debtor's **wages** held by a third-party
garnishee (the employer) via a **writ of garnishment of earnings** under
**A.R.S. § 12-1598 et seq.**:

- The creditor applies for the writ; it is served on the garnishee
  employer with notice to the judgment debtor.
- The garnishee files an **answer** disclosing the debtor's earnings;
  the debtor may file a **written objection / request for hearing**
  within the period the papers specify.
- Withholding is capped per pay period. The federal CCPA garnishment cap
  (15 U.S.C. §§ 1671-1677) sets a wage-protection floor; Arizona's
  earnings-garnishment limit and any head-of-household / hardship
  reduction live in the corpus — **verify the current cap and the
  objection deadline**.

### Garnishment — non-earnings (A.R.S. § 12-1570 et seq.)

A **non-earnings writ** under **A.R.S. § 12-1570 et seq.** reaches
**bank accounts** and other non-wage monies or property held by a
garnishee for the debtor. The garnishee answers; the debtor may object
and claim exemptions within the window. Verify the service mechanics,
answer deadline, and objection window in the corpus.

### Writ of execution — A.R.S. § 12-1551 et seq.

A **writ of execution** under **A.R.S. § 12-1551 et seq.** directs the
sheriff to levy on and sell the debtor's **non-exempt** property to
satisfy the judgment. Note that the writ must issue while the judgment
remains enforceable — see renewal below.

### Judgment liens on real property — A.R.S. § 33-961 et seq.

Recording a **certified copy of the judgment** (or a statutorily
prescribed information statement) with the county recorder creates a
**judgment lien on the debtor's real property** in that county under
**A.R.S. § 33-961 et seq.** The lien's **duration and renewal** track
the judgment's life; the **homestead exemption** (below) carves out
protected equity. Verify the recording requirements and lien term in the
corpus.

### Debtor's examination / supplemental proceedings

To **locate assets**, the creditor may compel the judgment debtor (or a
third party) to appear and answer under oath about income, property, and
accounts — a **debtor's examination**. Failure to appear after proper
service can expose the debtor to **contempt**. Confirm the current
procedure and notice requirement in the corpus.

### Renewal of judgment — A.R.S. §§ 12-1611 / 12-1612

An Arizona judgment is enforceable for a **statutory term** (point to
the corpus for the current number of years), after which it must be
**renewed** to remain collectible:

- **A.R.S. § 12-1611** — renewal **by action** within the statutory
  term.
- **A.R.S. § 12-1612** — renewal **by affidavit**: the creditor records
  and files an **affidavit of renewal** within the window before the
  judgment expires, restarting the enforcement clock.

> ⚠ **Verify the current judgment term and the renewal window.** Missing
> the renewal deadline lets the judgment **expire** and become
> unenforceable. Conversely, a debtor facing collection on an **old,
> un-renewed** judgment should check whether it lapsed. Confirm the
> current term and timing in the corpus — see `az-deadlines`.

### Exemptions from execution — A.R.S. § 33-1101 / § 33-1121 et seq.

A debtor may protect property through statutory **exemptions**:

- **Homestead** in the residence — **A.R.S. § 33-1101**. The exemption
  amount was **recently increased** and is **annually adjusted**; the
  homestead attaches to certain proceeds and interacts with recorded
  judgment liens.
- **Personal-property** exemptions — **A.R.S. § 33-1121 et seq.**
  (household furnishings, clothing, tools of the trade, a motor-vehicle
  value, certain bank-account funds, and prescribed benefits).
- **Earnings-garnishment limits** (above) and categorically protected
  funds — **Social Security** (42 U.S.C. § 407), certain public
  benefits and retirement accounts.

> ⚠ **Do not rely on an exemption dollar amount from memory.** Arizona's
> homestead figure (A.R.S. § 33-1101) and the § 33-1121-series
> personal-property amounts are set and **periodically adjusted by
> statute**. **Look up the current amounts in the corpus** before
> asserting them.

To claim an exemption, the debtor files the written **objection / claim
of exemption** with the issuing court within the period the garnishment
or levy papers specify; the court then resolves it. Act promptly — see
`az-deadlines`.

### Satisfaction of judgment

When a judgment is paid in full, the **satisfaction** should be entered
of record. The creditor ordinarily files and (where a lien was recorded)
records a **satisfaction of judgment**; if the creditor refuses after
payment, the debtor may move the court to enter satisfaction with proof.
Verify any statutory duty/penalty for failure to acknowledge
satisfaction after demand in the corpus.

## Common pro se scenarios

1. **Debt-buyer default judgment** — Rule 60(b) motion to set aside on
   defective service / excusable neglect plus a meritorious defense
   (chain of title, SOL). See `az-consumer-debt`.
2. **Bank account holding Social Security garnished** — assert the 42
   U.S.C. § 407 exemption and any A.R.S. § 33-1121-series exemption;
   file the objection within the non-earnings-writ window.
3. **Wage garnishment** — confirm withholding is within the CCPA cap and
   the current A.R.S. § 12-1598 earnings limit; raise head-of-household
   / hardship where available.
4. **Old judgment surfaces** — check whether it was **renewed** under
   A.R.S. § 12-1611 / § 12-1612 within the statutory term, or whether it
   has **expired**.
5. **Creditor demands a debtor exam** — appear and answer to avoid
   contempt.
