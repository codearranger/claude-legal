In Arizona, the key mechanic is different from a self-set "motion day."
Under **Ariz. R. Civ. P. 7.1**, a party may **request oral argument**
on a motion (typically by a notation in the caption or a separate
request stating the time estimate), but **the court decides whether to
hold argument** and, if it does, **sets the date.** Many civil motions
are decided on the briefs without argument. The movant does not
unilaterally reserve a date; the request goes in and the court (or its
division) responds.

How the date actually gets set then varies by court:

1. **Assigned-division/judge setting.** In **Maricopa County Superior
   Court** and **Pima County Superior Court**, each case is assigned to
   a division/judge who controls the calendar. Whether and when oral
   argument is set — and the channel for requesting it (caption
   notation, separate Rule 7.1 request, division contact, or portal) —
   follows that division's procedures, which differ between and within
   the two counties.
2. **Scheduling / case-management conferences (Rule 16).** Separate
   from motion argument, the court sets **Rule 16 scheduling or
   case-management conferences** to manage the case. These are
   court-initiated (often by order after the case is at issue); the
   parties may be required to confer and submit a joint report before
   the conference.
3. **Compulsory arbitration hearings (Rules 72-77).** Cases at or
   below the county's jurisdictional-amount threshold are subject to
   **compulsory arbitration** under **Ariz. R. Civ. P. 72-77**. The
   arbitration hearing is set by the **assigned arbitrator** (not the
   judge), after appointment, in coordination with the parties — a
   different scheduling track from motion argument.

Always confirm the venue's actual mechanism. Some divisions set
argument by minute entry, some require a separate request, and limited-
jurisdiction courts handle setting their own way.

## General workflow

The shape is: **request → court sets → notice**, not self-set.

1. **File the motion with an oral-argument request** if argument is
   wanted, per Ariz. R. Civ. P. 7.1. State a time estimate. The motion
   is briefed under the Rule 7.1 response/reply timeline before the
   court rules on whether to hear it.
2. **The court decides and sets the date.** The assigned division
   either rules on the briefs or issues a minute entry / order setting
   oral argument with a date, time, and (in-person or remote)
   appearance instructions.
3. **Receive and calendar the notice.** When the court sets a hearing
   or conference, it issues the setting notice. Confirm the date,
   appearance method, and any pre-hearing submission, and calendar
   backward from it.

> Sequence note: in Arizona the movant generally does **not** pick the
> date. The request goes in with (or in) the motion, and the court's
> setting notice supplies the date. Do not draft a notice asserting a
> self-selected hearing date — confirm the division's practice first.

## When scheduling is initiated

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Motion ready; want oral argument | Include the Rule 7.1 oral-argument request with a time estimate; the court decides and sets — route to the venue skill for the request channel |
| Maricopa Superior Court case | Follow the assigned division's argument-setting procedure (caption notation / separate request / division contact); see `az-maricopa` |
| Pima Superior Court case | Follow the assigned division's procedure; see `az-pima` |
| Rule 16 scheduling / case-management conference | Court-initiated; confer with opposing party and submit any required joint report before the date |
| Compulsory arbitration (Rules 72-77) case | Hearing is set by the appointed arbitrator in coordination with the parties, not by the judge |
| Limited-jurisdiction (justice court) hearing | Setting follows justice-court practice — often clerk- or court-assigned; see `az-justice-courts` |
| Hearing already set; need to continue/vacate | Move (or stipulate) to continue with proposed dates per the division's procedure; do not assume a stipulation alone moves the date |
| Emergency / ex parte / TRO relief | Contact the assigned division / clerk immediately and follow the court's ex parte / Rule 65 procedure |

## Contact channels and scheduling systems

Channels differ by court and by individual division/judge and change at
judicial rotation. **Do not cache or guess division phone numbers,
email addresses, request forms, or portal URLs** — fetch the current
procedure from the filing court's website, its local rules, or the
assigned judge's published procedures. Arizona Superior Courts use
**AZTurboCourt** for e-filing in many counties; confirm whether the
oral-argument request and any setting flow through the portal.

### Per-venue routing notes

Starting points only — each court's local rules and the assigned
division's procedures control.

| Court | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Maricopa County Superior Court (Phoenix)** | Case assigned to a division/judge that controls argument setting; the Rule 7.1 request channel and whether argument is heard follow that division's procedures. AZTurboCourt e-filing. Route to `az-maricopa`. |
| **Pima County Superior Court (Tucson)** | Assigned-division setting; procedures differ from Maricopa and between divisions. Route to `az-pima`. |
| **Other Superior Courts** | Assigned-division setting is the norm statewide; confirm the county's local rules. See `az-superior-courts`. |
| **Justice courts (limited jurisdiction)** | Setting follows justice-court practice, often clerk-/court-assigned on a periodic civil docket. See `az-justice-courts`. |

## Scheduling-request plan

Produce a short plan capturing, for the chosen venue:

- Whether oral argument is being requested under Rule 7.1, the exact
  request channel (caption notation / separate request / division
  contact / portal), and the **time estimate** stated.
- The expectation that the **court sets the date** — and where the
  setting notice will arrive (minute entry / portal / mail).
- The Rule 7.1 response/reply briefing timeline backed out so the
  motion is fully briefed before the court rules on setting.
- For a Rule 16 conference: any joint-report / conferral obligation and
  its due date relative to the conference.
- For a compulsory-arbitration matter (Rules 72-77): the arbitrator-
  appointment status and that the hearing is set with the arbitrator.
- A log of any scheduling contact (date/time, person/division, what was
  said), kept to pure scheduling logistics.

**Avoid ex parte communication** with the court on anything beyond pure
scheduling logistics, and include the opposing party when coordinating
availability.

## Hearing-length estimation guidance

A realistic time estimate helps the division decide and set argument.

| Motion / event | Typical estimate |
|---|---|
| Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss | 20-45 min (often decided on briefs) |
| Rule 56 summary judgment | 30-60 min (often briefed; argument discretionary) |
| Discovery / motion to compel | 15-30 min |
| Motion to set aside default (Rule 60) | 20-45 min |
| Rule 16 scheduling / case-management conference | 15-30 min |
| Compulsory-arbitration hearing (Rules 72-77) | half-day to full-day, set with arbitrator |
| TRO / preliminary injunction (Rule 65) | 30-180 min (often evidentiary) |
