# Draft a Tennessee Notice of Hearing

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** This skill scaffolds a notice document. Verify
> the filing court's local rules and the assigned judge's standing
> orders — especially how hearing dates are obtained — before filing.

In Tennessee civil practice the scheduling document that places a
motion on the court's calendar is the **Notice of Hearing**. It tells
all parties when and where the court will hear a previously filed
motion. The Notice of Hearing serves the motion's hearing date under
**Tenn. R. Civ. P. 5** and is filed in the underlying Circuit or
Chancery case.

> **General Sessions is different.** General Sessions practice is
> informal and the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure generally do not
> apply there. A General Sessions matter is set by a return date / court
> date assigned when the civil warrant issues, not by a party-filed
> Notice of Hearing. See `tn-general-sessions`.

## Coordinate the date first — this varies by county

Many Tennessee Circuit and Chancery courts require the filer to
**obtain or coordinate a hearing date** from the judge's office, the
docket clerk, or the Clerk & Master (in Chancery) **before** serving a
Notice of Hearing — you cannot simply pick a date and notice it. Other
courts run a standing motion docket on set days where motions are heard
without an individually assigned time. Practice differs by county and
by judge.

- **Check the local rules** of the filing court (indexed on the AOC
  "Local Rules of Practice" page at tncourts.gov) and the assigned
  judge's standing orders.
- **Use `tn-schedule-hearing`** for the mechanics of contacting the
  judge's office / docket clerk to secure a date.
- Confirm any **minimum-notice** requirement — for a summary-judgment
  motion under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 56.04, the motion must be served **at
  least 30 days before the hearing**; other motions may carry a
  shorter local-rule notice period. Use `tn-deadlines` to compute the
  date and any Rule 6.05 mail add-on.

## Other party-filed notices

| Notice | Filer | Purpose | Authority |
|--------|-------|---------|-----------|
| Notice of Hearing | Movant | Sets a filed motion for hearing | Tenn. R. Civ. P. 5 + local rules |
| Notice of Filing | Filer | Cover notice accompanying a filed document or exhibit | local practice |
| Notice of Voluntary Dismissal | Plaintiff | Voluntary dismissal under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 41.01 | Tenn. R. Civ. P. 41.01 |
| Notice of Appeal (Sessions → Circuit) | Appealing party | Triggers de novo appeal within 10 days | Tenn. Code Ann. § 27-5-108 |
| Notice of Change of Address | Party / counsel | Updates the service address of record | Tenn. R. Civ. P. 5 |

### Notice of Voluntary Dismissal — Tenn. R. Civ. P. 41.01

A plaintiff generally may take a **voluntary nonsuit** (dismissal
without prejudice) by filing a written notice of dismissal, subject to
the limits in Rule 41.01 (e.g., once a motion for summary judgment is
pending, or where a counterclaim has been pleaded that cannot remain
pending for independent adjudication). A **second** voluntary dismissal
of a claim based on or including the same claim may operate as an
adjudication on the merits. Verify the current rule text and track any
prior dismissals before filing.

### General Sessions de novo appeal notice

To appeal a General Sessions judgment to Circuit Court for trial **de
novo**, the appealing party must perfect the appeal within **10 days**
of entry of the judgment under Tenn. Code Ann. § 27-5-108 (uniform
statewide 10-day period; perfecting also involves the appeal
bond/cost requirements with the Sessions clerk — confirm the clerk's
exact procedure). See `tn-post-judgment` and `tn-general-sessions`.
