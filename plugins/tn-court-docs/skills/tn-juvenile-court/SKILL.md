# Tennessee Juvenile Court — Title 37

Tennessee's **Juvenile Courts** are creatures of **Title 37** of the
Tennessee Code. They are the venue for matters concerning **minors**
that fall outside a married-couple divorce. This skill covers what
Juvenile Court handles, how matters are routed there (versus to
Circuit / Chancery), and the magistrate / appeal structure. For the
substantive parentage, custody, and support law, see `tn-family-law`.
For document form, see `tn-statewide-format`.

## What Juvenile Court handles (for minors)

| Matter | Authority |
|---|---|
| **Parentage / paternity and legitimation** | Title 37 (with the Title 36 ch. 2 parentage statutes) |
| **Custody and support of children of UNMARRIED parents** | Title 37 |
| **Dependency and neglect** | Title 37 (Tenn. Code Ann. § 37-1-101 et seq.) |
| **Termination of parental rights (TPR)** | Title 37 / Title 36 ch. 1 |
| **Delinquency and unruly children** | Title 37 |

Once parentage and custody are before the Juvenile Court, the
**substantive standards are the same Title 36 framework** covered in
`tn-family-law`: child support follows the **income-shares model**
(§ 36-5-101; Guidelines at Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. ch. 1240-02-04), and
custody / parenting decisions apply the **best-interest factors at
§ 36-6-106(a)**. The forum differs; the substantive law does not.

## Routing — Juvenile vs. Circuit / Chancery

The dividing line is whether the parents were **married to each
other**:

- **Unmarried parents** → establishing parentage and the resulting
  custody / support order is a **Juvenile Court (Title 37)** matter.
  Use this skill.
- **Married or formerly married parents** → custody and support
  **incident to a divorce** (or post-divorce modification) is a
  **Circuit or Chancery Court** matter. Use `tn-family-court`, not
  this skill.

> State the routing plainly: divorce and married-parent custody do
> **not** go to Juvenile Court — they go to Circuit / Chancery
> (`tn-family-court`). Juvenile Court is for parentage,
> unmarried-parent custody/support, dependency/neglect, TPR, and
> delinquency.

There can be overlap — for example, parentage may be raised in more
than one proceeding, and a dependency/neglect or TPR case can run
alongside a custody case. Confirm the proper forum for the specific
facts before filing.

## Establishing parentage / paternity and legitimation

- A parentage or legitimation action establishes the **legal
  parent-child relationship** for a child whose parents were not
  married to each other. Tools include a **voluntary acknowledgment
  of paternity**, **genetic (DNA) testing**, and an adjudication of
  parentage.
- Once parentage is established, the court can enter **custody /
  parenting** and **child-support** orders applying the Title 36
  standards (see `tn-family-law`).
- The substantive parentage statutes sit in **Title 36, Chapter 2**;
  the Juvenile Court's authority to hear them sits in **Title 37**.
  Verify the current chapter, the standing rules, the acknowledgment
  and rescission timelines, and the genetic-testing provisions before
  drafting a petition.

## Dependency and neglect; termination of parental rights

- **Dependency and neglect** proceedings (Tenn. Code Ann.
  § 37-1-101 et seq.) address children alleged to be dependent,
  neglected, or abused, often involving the **Department of
  Children's Services (DCS)**. These cases follow their own statutory
  timeline (preliminary / adjudicatory / dispositional hearings) and
  a clear-and-convincing-evidence standard for adjudication — verify
  the current standards and timelines.
- **Termination of parental rights (TPR)** permanently severs the
  legal parent-child relationship and is the gateway to adoption. TPR
  requires proof of a **statutory ground** plus a **best-interest**
  finding, each by **clear and convincing evidence**. Grounds and the
  best-interest factors are statutory — research and cite the
  current provisions; do not rely on memory, as the grounds and the
  TPR best-interest factors have been amended.

> These are among the highest-stakes proceedings in Tennessee law.
> A parent may have a **right to appointed counsel** in dependency /
> neglect and TPR cases — confirm the current entitlement and advise
> the party to seek counsel.

## Magistrates and the appeal / rehearing path

Many Juvenile Court matters are heard in the first instance by a
**magistrate** (sometimes called a referee), whose findings and
recommendations are subject to **confirmation by the judge** and to a
party's right to request a **rehearing before the juvenile court
judge** within a short statutory window. Keep the two layers
distinct:

1. **Magistrate → juvenile court judge.** A party who disagrees with a
   magistrate's order may seek a **rehearing** before the juvenile
   court judge within the time set by Title 37 and the court's rules.
2. **Juvenile court → appeal.** From a final juvenile-court order,
   the appeal route depends on the **type of case**. Certain
   juvenile matters appeal **de novo to Circuit Court**, while others
   (notably termination of parental rights and dependency/neglect
   appeals in some configurations) follow a different appellate
   route. **The specific appeal route, the time to appeal, and any
   bond requirement vary by case type — verify the controlling Title
   37 provision for the specific order before relying on a particular
   route.**

> Do not assume a single appeal path. The rehearing-then-appeal
> structure and the destination of the appeal (Circuit Court de novo
> vs. the appellate courts) turn on the kind of juvenile order at
> issue. Confirm against current Title 37.

## Filing mechanics (overview)

- File in the **Juvenile Court** of the proper county (Tennessee has
  both dedicated juvenile courts and, in many counties, general
  sessions courts exercising juvenile jurisdiction — confirm the
  local court).
- Use `tn-statewide-format` for the Tenn. R. Civ. P. 10 caption,
  signature, and **redaction of minors' identifiers** (juvenile
  records carry heightened confidentiality — verify the current
  sealing / confidentiality rules).
- E-filing and forms are **county-by-county**; confirm the venue's
  platform and any AOC-approved juvenile forms with the relevant
  county skill.
