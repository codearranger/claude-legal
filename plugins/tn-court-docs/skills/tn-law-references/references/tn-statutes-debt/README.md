# tn-statutes-debt Corpus — Tennessee

Tennessee Code Annotated chapters covering the civil-practice +
consumer-debt + family-law + landlord-tenant + tort surface,
pulled by `scripts/pull_tn_statutes.py`.

Directory name retains the legacy `debt` slug for path stability
across the marketplace, but scope covers the full civil + family
practice surface.

## Sources and access posture

The Tennessee Code is published officially by **LexisNexis under
copyright** (the free `lexisnexis.com/hottopics/tncode/` mirror
is a JS container, not flat HTML). The structured free mirrors
are **Justia** (`law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/`) and **FindLaw**
(`codes.findlaw.com/tn/`). Both sit behind **Cloudflare bot-fight
mode** that fingerprints the TLS handshake — stdlib `urllib`
gets a 403 even from a residential IP.

**As of v0.2.0** the puller uses **`curl_cffi` with Chrome TLS
impersonation** to defeat the fingerprint check and walks
**Chapter → Part → Section** when a chapter is subdivided into
Parts. Run from a residential or VPN-routed IP, it produces
**verbatim Markdown** for all 25 chapters (~2.6 MB; 1,496
sections).

When fetch fails (no `curl_cffi` installed, blocked egress,
upstream structure change) the puller falls back to **well-formed
pointer stubs** carrying the canonical Justia URL plus the
official LexisNexis URL plus a one-line scope description —
mirroring the `pull_indiana_statutes.py` / `pull_ny_statutes.py`
"publish what we can verify + honest stubs for the rest"
discipline. The `_file_is_stub` regression guard preserves any
existing verbatim file rather than overwriting it with a stub on
re-run.

## How to refresh

```
python3 scripts/pull_tn_statutes.py --workers 4
```

Or to force pointer stubs only (useful for validating the stub
shape on a machine that CAN reach Justia):

```
python3 scripts/pull_tn_statutes.py --stubs-only
```

Wired into the quarterly `refresh-references` workflow under
`target=tn`. The `_file_is_stub` regression guard ensures that
any verbatim content already committed survives a stub-only CI
refresh (the worst case is a `Fetched:` date bump in the
manifest).
