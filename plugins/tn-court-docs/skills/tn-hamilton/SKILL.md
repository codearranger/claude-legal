## Caption — Hamilton County variants

```
        IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF HAMILTON COUNTY, TENNESSEE

[PLAINTIFF],                           )
       Plaintiff,                      )
v.                                     )   Docket No. ____________
[DEFENDANT],                           )
       Defendant.                      )

                  [DOCUMENT TITLE IN ALL CAPS]
```

For **Chancery Court**, the court identifier line reads
`IN THE CHANCERY COURT OF HAMILTON COUNTY, TENNESSEE` (some clerks add
"AT CHATTANOOGA") and the matter is heard by a **Chancellor** with the
**Clerk & Master** as clerk. Confirm the exact "for/of" preposition
and any city tag against current Hamilton County caption forms. For
**General Sessions**, see `tn-general-sessions`.

## Local rules — pull the current set every time

There is **no statewide page/margin/font rule** in Tennessee (see
`tn-statewide-format`). The Hamilton County courts publish **local
rules of practice** controlling page limits, chambers copies,
motion-docket scheduling, and filing mechanics, indexed on the
Administrative Office of the Courts "Local Rules of Practice" page at
**tncourts.gov**.

**Agent behavior:** before drafting a notice, scheduling a hearing, or
setting a page-limited brief, fetch the current Hamilton County local
rules for the controlling court and division. Confirm the
motion-docket day, chambers-copy requirement, e-filing platform, and
proposed-order format.

## Motion practice and summary judgment

- **Answer**: 30 days after service of the summons and complaint
  (Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.01).
- **Summary judgment**: served at least **30 days before the hearing**
  (Tenn. R. Civ. P. 56.04); response due no later than 5 days before
  the hearing; the *Celotex*-style standard of
  *Rye v. Women's Care Center of Memphis, MPLLC*, 477 S.W.3d 235
  (Tenn. 2015) governs. See `tn-first-30-days`.
