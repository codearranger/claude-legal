# Tennessee Hearings

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Hearing-preparation aid only. Verify against
> the assigned judge's standing orders, the venue's local rules, and
> the court's current remote-appearance instructions before any
> hearing.

Use this skill alongside `tn-statewide-format` and the specific court
skill (`tn-davidson`, `tn-shelby`, `tn-knox`, `tn-hamilton`,
`tn-county-courts`, `tn-general-sessions`) when preparing for,
attending, or following up on a hearing.

## Hearing settings in Tennessee — the basics

Hearing mechanics differ sharply by court type:

| Court | Typical hearing posture |
|---|---|
| **Circuit / Chancery** | Motions set for a **motion docket** or by special setting; the court may rule on the briefs or hear oral argument. Evidentiary hearings and bench trials are scheduled settings. |
| **General Sessions** | **Informal**, high-volume **docket call** at the assigned court date; the warrant is set for a date and the parties appear; matters are often heard and decided the same day. Continuances are common. See `tn-general-sessions`. |

> **General Sessions is a court-date model, not a briefing model.**
> When served with a civil warrant, the most important step is to
> **appear on the date stated** (or arrange a continuance). There is
> no formal motion-briefing track and no formal discovery as of right.

## Motion-day / docket-call dynamics

- **Circuit / Chancery motion dockets** — many counties hear civil
  motions on a recurring **motion day**. Confirm whether the venue
  requires the motion to be **set / noticed** for a specific motion
  day, whether the judge wants **chambers copies** in advance, and
  whether oral argument is expected or the matter is decided on the
  papers. These are **local-rule and standing-order** questions —
  check tncourts.gov for the venue's local rules and the assigned
  judge's standing order. See `tn-schedule-hearing`.
- **General Sessions docket call** — expect a crowded courtroom and a
  roll call of cases. Be present and ready when your case is called;
  know whether you are seeking a continuance, announcing for trial, or
  resolving the matter.

## Remote appearances — varies by court

There is **no single statewide remote-appearance rule** in Tennessee.
Many courts conduct some hearings by **Zoom** or another platform, but
whether a given hearing is in-person, remote, or hybrid is set by the
**venue's local rule or the assigned judge's standing order**.

> Agent behavior: do **not** assume a platform or a meeting ID. Pull
> the assigned judge's current remote-appearance instructions from the
> venue's website or the most recent notice / standing order. Meeting
> IDs change — never cache or guess them.

If the hearing is remote, the general etiquette holds:

- Join **early** (10-15 minutes).
- Use your **full legal name** as the display name.
- **Mute** on entry; unmute only when addressed.
- **Camera on** unless the court orders otherwise.
- **Quiet, professional background**; test audio and video first.

## In-person hearings — etiquette

- Arrive **early** (30 minutes) to clear security.
- **Dress** in business attire; pro se filers should wear
  business-casual at minimum (no shorts, hats, or athletic wear).
- **Phones** silenced and put away.
- **Stand** when addressing the court ("May it please the Court, Your
  Honor").
- Address the judge as **"Your Honor"**; refer to opposing counsel and
  parties as **"Mr./Ms. [surname]"** — not first names — from the
  podium.

## Hearing-day packet — what to bring

| Item | Purpose |
|---|---|
| 2 paper copies of each filing (court + opposing party) | Even in e-filed cases, have hard copies at the podium |
| Chambers copy (if the judge's standing order requires one) | Delivered in advance for longer motions |
| The relevant rules / statutes (printed, tabbed) | Have Tenn. R. Civ. P. and Tenn. R. Evid. excerpts at hand |
| Key cases (printed; Bluebooked, with published/unpublished noted) | Flag the dispositive authorities |
| Witness outlines (if evidentiary) | One per witness; sequential exam outline |
| Exhibit list + copies | Original + court copy + opposing-party copy of each exhibit |
| Proposed order (1 copy + 1 spare) | The court may sign in chambers; see `tn-submit-order` |
| Notepad + 2 pens | Notes during the hearing |

## Oral argument — structure

A workable structure for a Tennessee civil motion:

1. **Opening** (~30 sec). "May it please the Court, [Name] for the
   [Plaintiff / Defendant / Petitioner / Respondent]. This is
   [Movant]'s Motion to [Dismiss / Compel / for Summary Judgment]. We
   respectfully ask the Court to [grant / deny] for [N] reasons."
2. **Roadmap** (~30 sec). "First... Second... Third..."
3. **Substantive argument** — lead with the strongest point; cite the
   governing Tenn. R. Civ. P., Tenn. R. Evid., or case; tie back to
   the record.
4. **Address counter-arguments candidly** — answer the court's
   questions directly; do not duck weaknesses.
5. **Reserve rebuttal** if you are the movant.
6. **Closing** (~15 sec). "For these reasons, [Movant] respectfully
   asks the Court to [grant / deny]. Thank you, Your Honor."

## Evidentiary hearings — special considerations

For evidentiary hearings (a Rule 56 motion with disputed material
facts, injunctions, contempt, post-judgment debtor exams):

- **Subpoena witnesses** well in advance under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 45.
- **Pre-mark exhibits** per the division's numbering convention.
- **Witness sequestration** — request under Tenn. R. Evid. 615 if
  helpful.
- **Stipulations** — confer beforehand to stipulate to undisputed
  facts and to authentication of routine business records under Tenn.
  R. Evid. 803(6) / 902 (see `tn-law-references`).
- **Record** — confirm with the clerk whether the proceeding is
  recorded by the court system or by an outside court reporter.

## Continuances

- **Confer with the opposing party first** — joint or unopposed
  motions to continue are far more likely to be granted.
- File the motion to continue **before** the setting, stating the
  current date, the reason, whether opposing party agrees, and
  proposed new dates. Many divisions want a proposed order.
- In **General Sessions**, a continuance is often requested by
  appearing on the court date and asking for a reset; follow the
  court's practice. See `tn-general-sessions`.
