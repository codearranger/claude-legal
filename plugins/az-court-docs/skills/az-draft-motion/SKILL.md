# Draft an Arizona Motion

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** This skill scaffolds a draft motion as a
> drafting aid. The user — not the skill — chooses the motion
> type, the theory of relief, and the strategy. Verify every
> rule, deadline, and citation against the current Arizona Rules
> of Civil Procedure and controlling case law before filing.

Use this skill to produce a **motion + supporting memorandum +
proposed form of order** in Arizona format. The form and
presentation of motions is governed by **Ariz. R. Civ. P. 7.1**.
The caption, signature block (with the State Bar of Arizona bar
number), and certificate of service follow `az-statewide-format`.

## Ariz. R. Civ. P. 7.1 — form and presentation of motions

**Rule 7.1** governs how a written motion is made, supported, and
briefed. Confirm the current subdivision text in
`az-law-references` before relying on the points below:

- **Rule 7.1(a)** — a motion must be in writing (unless made
  during a hearing or trial), state the grounds on which it is
  based and the relief or order sought, and be **accompanied by a
  supporting memorandum** (memorandum of points and authorities)
  unless the motion type is exempt. The motion and its memorandum
  are typically presented as a single combined document.
- **Rule 7.1(c)** — a party may include a **request for oral
  argument** at the foot of the motion or response (commonly
  "Oral argument requested"). The court may rule on the motion
  with or without oral argument; verify the current text and any
  local-rule or division practice on oral-argument requests.
- **Response and reply sequence** — Rule 7.1 sets the time to file
  a **response** and a **reply**, and the standard notice periods.
  Confirm the current day counts and compute the dates with
  `az-deadlines` (which applies Ariz. R. Civ. P. 6 time
  computation and the service add-ons).

A motion that presents an issue of fact must be supported by an
**affidavit or declaration** or other evidence (see
`az-draft-declaration`).

## Page limits and typography

Arizona sets motion **page limits by rule and by local rule** —
the limit and any chambers-copy or courtesy-copy requirement are
not embedded here. Check the applicable Ariz. R. Civ. P.
provision, the local rules of the filing Superior Court, and the
assigned division's procedures before finalizing. See
`az-statewide-format` and the venue overlay, and consult
`az-law-references` for the corpus of court rules and the
page-limit lookup. Do not hard-code a page count in a draft.

         [DOCUMENT TITLE IN ALL CAPS, e.g.,
     DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
     (Oral Argument Requested)]

[Movant], [Plaintiff / Defendant], by [counsel / in propria
persona] and pursuant to Ariz. R. Civ. P. 7.1 and [specific rule,
e.g., Ariz. R. Civ. P. 56], moves the Court for [specific relief].
The grounds for this Motion are stated below and in the supporting
Memorandum of Points and Authorities that follows.

         MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

                       I. INTRODUCTION
[1-2 paragraph summary of the case, the relief sought, and the
reasons in headline form.]

                  II. STATEMENT OF FACTS
[Numbered factual paragraphs. Each material fact gets a record
citation — Declaration/Affidavit ¶ X, Complaint ¶ X, Exhibit X,
deposition page/line, or admission in the pleadings. Sworn facts
belong in a declaration or affidavit; see az-draft-declaration.]

                  III. LEGAL ARGUMENT
A. [Headline of first argument.]
[Lead with the rule citation; state the controlling standard;
apply it to the facts; cite controlling Arizona authority.]

B. [Headline of second argument.]

                  IV. CONCLUSION AND RELIEF
For the foregoing reasons, [Movant] respectfully requests that the
Court [grant the relief sought] and sign the accompanying proposed
form of Order.

Oral argument requested. [Rule 7.1(c) — include if desired.]

                                     [Signature block —
                                      see az-statewide-format]
                                     [Certificate of service]
```

The **proposed form of order** is drafted as a **separate**
document and lodged with the motion — see `az-draft-order`.

## Summary judgment — Ariz. R. Civ. P. 56 and the *Orme School* standard

The most common dispositive motion in Arizona is the **motion for
summary judgment under Ariz. R. Civ. P. 56**. Summary judgment is
granted when there is **no genuine dispute as to any material
fact** and the moving party is entitled to **judgment as a matter
of law**; the court views the evidence in the light most favorable
to the party opposing the motion.

The governing Arizona standard is set out in **Orme School v.
Reeves, 166 Ariz. 301, 802 P.2d 1000 (1990)** (verify the citation
and the current case law refining it before relying on it).
*Orme School* holds that summary judgment is appropriate where the
facts produced in opposition to the motion have **so little
probative value, given the quantum of evidence required, that
reasonable people could not agree** with the conclusion advanced
by the proponent of the claim or defense — i.e., a mere "scintilla"
of evidence is not enough to defeat the motion. Once the movant
shows the absence of a genuine dispute, the nonmovant must come
forward with specific facts (not mere allegations) showing a
genuine issue for trial.

> A Rule 56 motion is typically accompanied by supporting
> **declarations or affidavits** and documentary exhibits (see
> `az-draft-declaration`), and many courts require a separately
> filed **statement of facts**. Confirm the current Rule 56 text
> and the filing court's statement-of-facts and separate-statement
> practice in `az-law-references`.

## Common motion types

| Motion | Rule | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Motion for Summary Judgment | Ariz. R. Civ. P. 56 | *Orme School* standard; supporting declarations/exhibits; check statement-of-facts practice |
| Motion to Dismiss | Ariz. R. Civ. P. 12(b) | Including 12(b)(6) failure to state a claim |
| Motion to Compel Discovery | Ariz. R. Civ. P. 37 | Attach the deficient responses; satisfy the good-faith-consultation / Rule 7.1 requirement |
| Motion for New Trial / to Alter or Amend | Ariz. R. Civ. P. 59 | Verify the current time limit and grounds |
| Motion for Relief from Judgment | Ariz. R. Civ. P. 60 | Mistake, newly discovered evidence, fraud, void judgment, etc. |

## The pro-se drafting framework — applied to motions

Self-represented filers should follow the **pro-se drafting
framework** (see `az-pro-se`):

1. **State the relief clearly** in the opening sentence.
2. **Cite the rule** (Ariz. R. Civ. P. ____) that grants the court
   power to award that relief, per Rule 7.1(a).
3. **State the facts** that satisfy each element of the standard,
   with record citations to a supporting declaration.
4. **Apply the controlling Arizona case law** to those facts.
5. **Conclude** with the specific order sought, and lodge a
   proposed form of order (see `az-draft-order`).
