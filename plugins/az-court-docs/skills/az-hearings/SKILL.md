# Arizona Hearings

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Hearing-preparation aid only. Verify against the
> assigned judge's procedures, the court's local rules, and the court's
> current remote-appearance instructions before any hearing.

Use this skill alongside `az-statewide-format` and the specific venue
skill (`az-maricopa`, `az-pima`, `az-superior-courts`,
`az-justice-courts`) when preparing for, attending, or following up on a
hearing.

## Motion practice and oral argument — Ariz. R. Civ. P. 7.1

Civil motion practice is governed statewide by **Ariz. R. Civ. P. 7.1**.
Key mechanics (see `az-law-references` for current text, day counts, and
page limits):

- **Motion, response, reply** — Rule 7.1(a): a motion states the relief
  sought and the grounds, and is supported by a memorandum where required.
  The opposing party files a **response** within the rule's window
  (generally **10 days** after service of the motion under Rule 7.1(a)(3);
  add time for service by mail under **Rule 6(c)**), and the movant may
  file a **reply**. Compute every date with `az-deadlines`.
- **Request for oral argument** — **Rule 7.1(c)**: a party may **request
  oral argument**, typically by including the request in the caption or
  in the motion/response. The request is a request, not a guarantee.
- **Court may decide on the briefs** — under **Rule 7.1(c)** the court
  **may decide the motion without oral argument**. Do not assume you will
  be heard live; many civil motions are submitted on the briefs. Check the
  assigned judge's procedures and watch the docket for either a hearing
  notice or a ruling under advisement.
- **Accelerated / expedited rulings** — the court may shorten time where
  grounds exist; confirm whether the matter is set on shortened time.

> Agent behavior: do **not** state that oral argument will occur. Frame it
> as requested under Rule 7.1(c) and contingent on the court setting it.

## Remote and telephonic appearances

Arizona courts broadly adopted **video and telephonic proceedings**
following the 2020 Arizona Supreme Court administrative orders, and remote
appearances remain widely available at the court's discretion. Many
Superior Court and Justice Court matters — status conferences, oral
argument, some evidentiary hearings — proceed by **two-way video** (often
a court-hosted platform) or by telephone.

> Agent behavior: do **not** assume a platform or a meeting ID. Whether a
> hearing is in-person, video, or telephonic is set by the court's current
> practice and the assigned judge. **Confirm the court's current
> remote-appearance practice** and pull the link/dial-in from the court's
> website or the most recent notice. Meeting IDs change — never cache or
> guess them.

If the hearing is remote, the general etiquette holds:

- Join **early** (10-15 minutes) using the court's published link/number.
- Use your **full legal name** as the display name.
- **Mute** on entry; unmute only when addressed.
- **Camera on** unless the court directs otherwise.
- **Quiet, professional background**; test audio and video first.

## Scheduling and case-management conferences — Rule 16

**Ariz. R. Civ. P. 16** governs the **scheduling conference** and
**case-management conference**. The court typically enters a **scheduling
order** fixing discovery deadlines, disclosure obligations, ADR/arbitration
status, dispositive-motion cutoffs, and trial. Come prepared to discuss the
Rule 16 agenda items (the proposed case-management plan, discovery scope,
ADR, and a realistic trial timeframe).

- **Comprehensive pretrial conference** — Rule 16 also provides for a
  **comprehensive (final) pretrial conference** before trial, where the
  court addresses the joint pretrial statement, exhibits, witnesses,
  motions in limine, and trial logistics. Arrive with the pretrial
  statement complete and exhibits pre-marked.
- Confirm whether each Rule 16 conference is in person, by video, or
  telephonic.

## Compulsory arbitration — Rules 72-77

Civil cases at or below the county's jurisdictional threshold are subject
to **compulsory arbitration** under **Ariz. R. Civ. P. 72-77**. The
threshold is set by **local rule per county** (commonly $50,000 in the
larger counties) — confirm the current figure for the venue via
`az-law-references` / the local rule before assuming a case is in or out.

- **Arbitrator appointment** — Rule 73: the court appoints an arbitrator
  from the county list (members of the State Bar of Arizona).
- **Hearing window** — the arbitration **hearing** is set within the
  rule's window after the arbitrator's appointment (generally **not fewer
  than 60 nor more than 120 days**). The **Arizona Rules of Evidence apply**
  at the hearing (Rule 75).
- **Award and appeal de novo** — the arbitrator issues a written award; any
  party may **appeal for a trial de novo** in Superior Court within the
  rule's deadline, after which the case proceeds as an ordinary lawsuit
  (discovery and jury trial available). Note the rule's **cost/sanction
  consequences** for an appellant who fails to improve on the award.

Settlement conferences and other ADR (mediation) may also be ordered;
arrive with settlement authority and a current exposure analysis.

## In-person hearings — etiquette

- Arrive **early** (30 minutes) to clear security.
- **Dress** in business attire; self-represented filers should wear
  business-casual at minimum (no shorts, hats, or athletic wear).
- **Phones** silenced and put away.
- **Stand** when addressing the court ("May it please the Court, Your
  Honor").
- Address the judge as **"Your Honor"**; refer to opposing counsel and
  parties by **"Mr./Ms. [surname]"** from the podium.

## Hearing-day packet — what to bring

| Item | Purpose |
|---|---|
| 2 paper copies of each filing (court + opposing party) | Even in e-filed (AZTurboCourt) cases, have hard copies at the podium |
| Judge's copy (if local rule / procedures require one) | Some courts want a courtesy copy in advance |
| The relevant Ariz. R. Civ. P. / Ariz. R. Evid. excerpts (printed, tabbed) | Have the governing rule text at hand (see `az-law-references`) |
| Key cases (printed; flagged published vs. depublished) | Flag the dispositive authorities |
| Witness outlines (if evidentiary) | One per witness; sequential exam outline |
| Exhibit list + copies | Original + court copy + opposing-party copy of each exhibit |
| Proposed order / form of judgment (1 copy + 1 spare) | The court may sign at the hearing; see `az-submit-order` |
| Notepad + 2 pens | Notes during the hearing |

## Oral argument — structure

A workable structure for an Arizona civil motion:

1. **Opening** (~30 sec). "May it please the Court, [Name] for the
   [Plaintiff / Defendant]. This is [Movant]'s Motion to [Dismiss /
   Compel / for Summary Judgment]. We respectfully ask the Court to
   [grant / deny] for [N] reasons."
2. **Roadmap** (~30 sec). "First... Second... Third..."
3. **Substantive argument** — lead with the strongest point; cite the
   governing Ariz. R. Civ. P., Ariz. R. Evid., or case; tie back to the
   record.
4. **Address counter-arguments candidly** — answer the court's questions
   directly; do not duck weaknesses.
5. **Reserve rebuttal** if you are the movant.
6. **Closing** (~15 sec). "For these reasons, [Movant] respectfully asks
   the Court to [grant / deny]. Thank you, Your Honor."

## Evidentiary hearings — special considerations

For evidentiary hearings (injunctions, contempt, post-judgment debtor
exams, disputed-fact motions, arbitration hearings under Rules 72-77):

- **Subpoena witnesses** in advance under Ariz. R. Civ. P. 45.
- **Pre-mark exhibits** per the court's numbering convention.
- **Witness exclusion** — request under Ariz. R. Evid. 615 if helpful.
- **Stipulations** — confer beforehand to stipulate to undisputed facts and
  to authentication of routine business records under Ariz. R. Evid.
  803(6) / 902 (see `az-law-references`).
- **Record** — confirm with the clerk how the proceeding is recorded (and
  how the record is made for a remote/telephonic hearing).

## Adjournments / continuances

- **Confer with the opposing party first** — stipulated or unopposed
  motions to continue are far more likely to be granted.
- File the motion / stipulation **before** the setting, stating the current
  date, the reason, whether opposing counsel agrees, and proposed new
  dates. Many courts want a proposed order.
