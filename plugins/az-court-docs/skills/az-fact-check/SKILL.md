# Fact-Check Arizona Court Filings

Use this skill before any Arizona court filing leaves the desk. It
runs four passes. It is the deeper evidentiary-citation pass;
`az-quality-check` is the lighter format-and-content pass. This skill
points at the canonical corpora rather than embedding statute text or
section numbers — pull current text from `az-law-references`.

## The Arizona forum trap — verify the right rule SET first

Arizona uses **different procedural rule sets depending on the
forum**, and a filing that cites the wrong set is defective even if
the quoted text is otherwise accurate. Before checking individual
cites, confirm the document's rule citations match its court:

- **Superior Court, general civil** → **Ariz. R. Civ. P.** (e.g.,
  Rule 8 pleading, Rule 12 motions, Rule 56 summary judgment).
- **Superior Court, family-law matters (Title 25 — dissolution,
  legal decision-making/parenting time, child support, paternity)**
  → **Arizona Rules of Family Law Procedure (ARFLP)**, NOT the civil
  rules. A family petition citing "Ariz. R. Civ. P. 12" instead of
  the ARFLP analog is a red flag.
- **Justice Court (civil up to the jurisdictional cap, small claims,
  most eviction/forcible-detainer)** → **Justice Court Rules of Civil
  Procedure (JCRCP)**, NOT the Superior Court civil rules.
- **Evidence** in all of the above → **Ariz. R. Evid.**

Flag any filing whose rule set does not match the venue named in its
caption. When unsure which forum a document targets, resolve that
before Pass 1.

## Pass 1 — Citation verification

For every rule, statute, and case citation, verify:

- **Rule cited**: exists in the **correct rule set for the forum**
  (see the trap above) and says what the brief claims. Confirm the
  subdivision against current text via `az-law-references` /
  azcourts.gov. Arizona uses Rule-number plus lettered/numbered
  subparts (e.g., Ariz. R. Civ. P. 56(a)).
- **Statute cited**: exists at the cited section. Arizona statutes
  are the **Arizona Revised Statutes — A.R.S. § NN-NNN**. Confirm
  against `az-law-references` / azleg.gov; flag any section the brief
  invented or mis-numbered. Confirm limitations periods (A.R.S.
  Title 12, ch. 5) against current text rather than memory.
- **Federal statute cited**: exists at the cited subsection (e.g.,
  FDCPA at 15 U.S.C. § 1692 et seq.). Pull from the federal corpus.
- **Case cited**: exists; the reporter citation is correct; the
  proposition stands for what the brief claims; the case has not been
  overruled. Use **CourtListener** (Arizona Supreme Court = `ariz`,
  Court of Appeals = `arizctapp`) and the connected CourtListener MCP
  to confirm the case is real and read the holding.

### Arizona citation format checks (Bluebook / Arizona conventions)

Arizona follows **Bluebook** form with Arizona reporter abbreviations.
Verify each against current usage via `az-law-references`:

- Case form: `[Party A] v. [Party B], [###] Ariz. [###], [###] P.[2d/3d]
  [###] ([YEAR])` — a **comma** separates the official Arizona and
  the regional Pacific Reporter citations; periods in `Ariz.`,
  `Ariz. App.`, and `v.`
- Example: *Orme School v. Reeves*, 166 Ariz. 301, 802 P.2d 1000
  (1990).
- Court of Appeals uses **`Ariz. App.`** (older) or `Ariz.` with a
  division parenthetical for newer opinions — confirm the current
  form rather than assuming.
- Statutes: `A.R.S. § 12-541` (keep the `§`; "A.R.S." not "ARS").
  Rules: `Ariz. R. Civ. P. 56`, `ARFLP 78`, `JCRCP 121`,
  `Ariz. R. Evid. 803(6)`.
- Flag missing `§` on statutes, dropped periods in reporter
  abbreviations, and a wrong parallel-cite separator as a format WARN.

## Pass 2 — Internal consistency

Within a single document, verify:

- **Party names**: each party named consistently throughout (and in
  Bluebook `v.` form in any case caption).
- **Case number**: appears identically wherever it recurs, and
  matches the court named in the caption (Superior / Justice).
- **Dates**: every date is consistent across all appearances (date of
  service, date of contract, date of last payment, date judgment was
  entered). Deadlines that run from a stated date must be supported by
  that date.
- **Dollar amounts**: every amount is consistent and the totals add up
  (principal + interest + fees + costs = total demanded). Confirm the
  demand respects the venue's jurisdictional cap (Justice Court and
  small-claims limits differ from Superior Court).
- **Defined terms**: any term defined with `(the "Account")` is used
  consistently (no slipping into "the loan" or "the debt").
- **Cross-references**: every "see paragraph X" or "see Exhibit Y"
  resolves to a real location.
- **Numbered paragraphs**: sequential without gaps or duplicates.

## Pass 3 — Packet consistency

Across the multi-document packet (motion + supporting affidavit/
declaration + proposed order + certificate/proof of service):

- **Caption identical** in every document: court, county, party
  names, and case number must match exactly.
- **Document title** matches between the motion, its certificate of
  service, and the proposed order's title.
- **Dates align**: the certificate-of-service date should match the
  signature date on the motion; an affidavit's jurat date should
  align with when it was sworn.
- **Relief sought matches**: the motion's prayer ("WHEREFORE, movant
  respectfully requests ____") must mirror the proposed order's
  ordering language item by item.
- **Exhibits** referenced in the motion are described in the
  affidavit/declaration and physically attached.
- **Signature / Bar number**: each signed document carries the
  signer's signature and, for an attorney, the **State Bar of Arizona
  bar number**; a self-represented filer signs without one.
- **Page limits / typography**: verify against the applicable rule set
  and the venue's local rules; flag any limit you cannot confirm.

## Pass 4 — Sworn vs. argued

Compare what is sworn-to in the supporting affidavit/declaration
against what is argued in the motion or brief:

- Every **factual assertion** in the argument should be (a) supported
  by a citation to a paragraph of the affidavit/declaration, (b)
  admitted in the pleadings, or (c) a matter of judicial notice.
- Identify any factual claim in the brief **not** supported by the
  affidavit — a gap to fix before filing.
- Identify any sworn fact **not used** in the brief — consider whether
  it belongs in the affidavit at all.
- Verify the affidavit's **personal-knowledge foundation** and, for a
  business-records affidavit, that it satisfies the custodian /
  qualified-witness requirement of **Ariz. R. Evid. 803(6)** and any
  self-authentication under **Ariz. R. Evid. 902** (verify the exact
  902 sub-paragraph numbering against current text). Flag paragraphs
  that begin "I believe" or "I understand" without a foundation.

## Output format

When invoked on a packet, produce a structured verification report:

```
FACT-CHECK REPORT — [Document title / Case number]

Rule-set check
  PASS  Forum = Superior Court civil; cites Ariz. R. Civ. P. (correct)
  FAIL  Caption names Family Court (Title 25) but motion cites
        Ariz. R. Civ. P. 12 — should cite the ARFLP analog

Pass 1 (Citations)
  PASS  Ariz. R. Civ. P. 56(a)            — exists; correct subpart
  WARN  A.R.S. § 12-548                   — confirm written-contract
        limitations period against current A.R.S. text
  FAIL  Smith v. Jones, 999 Ariz. 1       — not found on CourtListener
        (ariz / arizctapp); verify the case is real
  WARN  Orme School v Reeves, 166 Ariz.   — Bluebook uses periods:
        301                                "Orme School v. Reeves"

Pass 2 (Internal consistency)
  PASS  Party names + case number consistent
  WARN  Paragraph numbering jumps from 6 to 8

Pass 3 (Packet consistency)
  PASS  Caption matches across motion, declaration, proposed order
  FAIL  Certificate of service dated before the motion signature date

Pass 4 (Sworn vs. argued)
  FAIL  Brief p.3 asserts "the collector held a license"; no
        corresponding declaration paragraph

Summary: 6 PASS / 3 WARN / 3 FAIL — DO NOT FILE until FAILs resolved.

## Composition

- For format checks: `az-statewide-format` + `scripts/format-check.py`
  on the generated document
- For deadline arithmetic checks (time computation, service add-ons,
  Arizona holidays): `az-deadlines`
- For the lighter pre-filing format-and-content pass: `az-quality-check`
- For canonical statute / rule text: `az-law-references`
- For venue caption + local-rule confirmation:
  `az-maricopa` / `az-pima` / `az-superior-courts` / `az-justice-courts`
- For family-forum rule-set confirmation (ARFLP): `az-family-court`
- For pro se signature conventions (no bar number): `az-pro-se`

## References

- `az-law-references` for canonical A.R.S. text; Ariz. R. Civ. P.,
  Ariz. R. Evid., Arizona Rules of Family Law Procedure (ARFLP), and
  Justice Court Rules of Civil Procedure (JCRCP); and Arizona/Bluebook
  citation conventions
- **CourtListener** (`ariz` Supreme Court, `arizctapp` Court of
  Appeals) and the connected CourtListener MCP to confirm a case is
  real and read its holding
- Confirm all citations against current authoritative sources before
  filing; this skill flags suspect citations but does not warrant
  their accuracy. Verify current local rules of the filing court.
