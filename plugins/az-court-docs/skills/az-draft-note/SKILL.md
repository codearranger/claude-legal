  This skill should be used to scaffold an Arizona Notice of Hearing —
  the document that asks the court to place a motion on its calendar for
  oral argument — and the related party-filed notices in Arizona civil
  practice. Triggers include "Arizona notice of hearing", "request oral
  argument Arizona Rule 7.1", "set a motion for hearing Arizona", "notice
  a hearing Arizona", "draft a notice of hearing for my motion", "ask for
  oral argument on my Arizona motion". In Arizona the request for oral
  argument is governed by Ariz. R. Civ. P. 7.1: a party may request oral
  argument, but the court decides whether to hold it or rule on the
  briefs, and in many Superior Courts the court — not the party — sets the
  hearing date after a request. Composes with `az-statewide-format` for
  the caption, `az-schedule-hearing` for obtaining or coordinating the
  date, and `az-draft-motion` for the underlying motion.

# Draft an Arizona Notice of Hearing

In Arizona civil practice, a motion is decided on the briefs unless the
court holds **oral argument**. The mechanism for asking the court to hear
a motion is a **request for oral argument** under Ariz. R. Civ. P. 7.1,
and the party-filed scheduling document is typically a **Notice of
Hearing** once a date exists. Arizona terminology and mechanics differ
from a "Note for Motion Docket" or a freestanding "Notice of Motion" —
the request and the noticing of a date travel with the motion and the
court's order.

## Ariz. R. Civ. P. 7.1 — requesting oral argument

Under **Ariz. R. Civ. P. 7.1**, a party may **request oral argument** on
a motion, but the **court decides** whether to hear argument or rule on
the written submissions. Two consequences flow from this:

- The request for oral argument is normally made **in the motion or
  response itself** (or in a separate request as the rule allows), not by
  a freestanding self-scheduled notice. Confirm the current text and the
  manner of making the request in **Ariz. R. Civ. P. 7.1** via
  `az-law-references`.
- Because the court controls whether argument is held, a party often
  cannot unilaterally place a motion on the calendar. In many Superior
  Courts the **court sets the date** after a request and issues a Notice
  of Hearing or minute entry; the party's Notice of Hearing then
  memorializes that court-assigned date for service on all parties.

Do **not** hard-code response/reply day counts or any minimum notice
period here. Confirm the briefing schedule and any notice-period figures
in the current text of the rule via `az-law-references`, and compute
dates with `az-deadlines`.

## Who sets the date — venue matters

How a motion hearing date is obtained varies sharply across Arizona
courts and judicial assignments:

- In many **Superior Courts**, the assigned division issues the hearing
  date by minute entry after a Rule 7.1 request — the party does **not**
  self-schedule. A party-filed Notice of Hearing then restates that date
  for service.
- Some divisions and the **limited-jurisdiction courts** run standing
  motion calendars or expect the filer to coordinate a date with the
  division clerk before noticing.
- Appearance method (in person vs. remote/telephonic) is set by the
  court and the assigned judge's practice.

Point to the venue skills before noticing, and use the scheduling skill
for the mechanics:

- **Use `az-schedule-hearing`** for obtaining or coordinating the date
  with the court before the Notice of Hearing is prepared.
- **Check the venue overlay** — `az-maricopa`, `az-pima`,
  `az-superior-courts`, `az-justice-courts` — for the local practice on
  who sets the date and how it is communicated.

## Certificate / proof of service — Rule 5

Service of the motion, the request for oral argument, and any Notice of
Hearing on every other party is governed by **Ariz. R. Civ. P. 5**. The
filing must include a **certificate of service** stating the date,
manner, and recipients. Confirm the current service manners (including
electronic service through the court's e-filing system) in
**Ariz. R. Civ. P. 5** via `az-law-references`.
