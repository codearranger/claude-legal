# Assemble an Arizona Court Filing Packet

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** This skill walks through filing mechanics.
> Verify the e-filing platform, document types, fees, redaction
> rule, and pro-se acceptance with the filing court's clerk before
> submitting.

Use this skill when ready to **submit** an Arizona trial-court
filing. First determine the **filing channel** for the venue, then
assemble and preflight the multi-document packet.

## Arizona e-filing — AZTurboCourt

**AZTurboCourt** is the Arizona Judicial Branch's statewide e-filing
portal. E-filing is **mandatory for represented (attorney) filers in
many Superior Courts** for many case types, while **self-represented
filers may generally e-file or paper-file** — but coverage and
mandates vary by court and case type.

Before assuming the channel, confirm for the specific court:

1. **Whether AZTurboCourt is live** in that court for the case type;
2. **Whether e-filing is mandatory** (typically for attorneys) or
   whether paper / over-the-counter filing is still accepted; and
3. The court's accepted document types and any document-naming
   convention.

Where the court is not on AZTurboCourt for the case type, file on
**paper** at the clerk's window (see below). **Justice Court filing
differs** — many Justice Courts use a different e-filing pathway or
take paper; see `az-justice-courts`.

## E-filing workflow (AZTurboCourt)

The portal shape is consistent across courts:

1. Register / log in to an AZTurboCourt account
2. Search for the case by case number or party name (or start a new
   case for an initial filing)
3. Select the court, case category, and the **filing / document
   type** for each component
4. Upload each component as a **separate PDF** (text-searchable;
   verify any size / bookmark requirements for long filings)
5. Pay any filing fee, or attach the **A.R.S. § 12-302** deferral /
   waiver application
6. Submit; the system returns a filing confirmation / file-stamp and
   may effect electronic service on registered parties

## Paper filing (courts / case types not on AZTurboCourt)

Where e-filing is unavailable, bring clean copies to the clerk's
window during business hours; the clerk file-stamps the original and
returns a stamped copy. Confirm whether the court accepts mail or
drop-box filings, and how many copies (judge's copy / conformed
copy) the court wants.

## Multi-document packet — typical components

A standard Arizona motion packet consists of these documents:

| # | Document | Authority / note |
|---|----------|------|
| 1 | Motion | Ariz. R. Civ. P. 7.1 |
| 2 | Memorandum / supporting argument | Ariz. R. Civ. P. 7.1; page limits are local |
| 3 | Affidavit or declaration | Sworn affidavit or unsworn declaration; Ariz. R. Evid. 803(6) records foundation |
| 4 | Exhibits | Attach written instruments referenced in the motion |
| 5 | Proposed form of order | Submitted with the motion; see `az-submit-order` |
| 6 | Certificate of Service | Ariz. R. Civ. P. 5(c) — date, method, recipients |

Choose the closest matching document-type label in the AZTurboCourt
menu; the menus vary by court and case category.

## Sensitive / personal information — redaction

Arizona **restricts sensitive and personal information** in court
filings. Before filing, review every component (including exhibits)
and handle protected data as the governing rule requires —
generally by **omitting or partially redacting** identifiers such as
Social Security / financial-account numbers and similar data, and
using any required **sensitive-data cover sheet / addendum**
mechanism where the data must reach the court but be kept out of the
public file.

> Verify the exact rule and procedure against `az-law-references` —
> the sensitive-data duty is **Ariz. R. Civ. P. 5.1(e)** (refrain
> from including Social Security and financial-account numbers; only
> the last 4 digits may be used; the redaction responsibility rests
> solely with the filer), and **Ariz. R. Civ. P. 5.4** separately
> governs sealing a document / restricting public access. Confirm the
> precise list of protected identifiers, the partial-redaction
> format, and whether a sensitive-data cover sheet is required. The
> filing court may have additional local requirements.

The filing party is responsible for the redaction; the clerk does
not redact for you.

## Preflight — run the helper scripts

Before assembling the packet:

```
# Format / caption + form check
python3 plugins/az-court-docs/scripts/format-check.py path/to/filing.docx

# Deadline arithmetic — Ariz. R. Civ. P. 6 computation, Rule 5(c)
# service add-ons, with Arizona court-holiday handling
python3 plugins/az-court-docs/scripts/case-calendar.py ...
```

Use `case-calendar.py` to confirm any hearing lead time and to
compute response deadlines with the applicable service add-on.

## Filing fees

Filing fees are set by statute and the clerk's fee schedule and vary
by court and case type. **Confirm the current amount with the filing
court's clerk** before submitting; do not hard-code a figure. Pay by
the portal's accepted method (card / e-check) or at the clerk's
cashier window for paper filings.

### Fee deferral / waiver — A.R.S. § 12-302

A filer who cannot afford the fees may apply to **defer** or
**waive** filing fees and costs under **A.R.S. § 12-302**. A
**deferral** postpones payment (fees become due later, often as a
payment plan); a **waiver** excuses them outright. File the
application with the first filing rather than paying and seeking a
refund. The court reviews the application and enters an order
granting, denying, deferring, or waiving fees. Verify the current
§ 12-302 standard and the operative application form with the clerk.
See `az-pro-se`.

## Filing vs. service — two distinct steps

Filing with the court is **not** the same as serving the opposing
party:

1. **Filing** — through AZTurboCourt or at the clerk's window.
2. **Service of process** (initial summons + complaint) — under
   **Ariz. R. Civ. P. 4 / 4.1 / 4.2**, with the summons issued under
   Rule 4 (verify the current summons life / return period).
3. **Service of subsequent papers** (motions, notices, orders) —
   under **Ariz. R. Civ. P. 5**, on every party by an allowed
   method; document it in the **Certificate of Service** under
   Rule 5(c). Add the applicable service period under Rule 6 when
   service is by mail or other non-personal method.

If AZTurboCourt performs electronic service on registered parties, a
party without an e-filing account must still be served by another
allowed Rule 5 method — confirm the portal's e-service coverage for
each party.
