Use this skill in addition to `az-statewide-format` when the
matter is a **civil** case in the **Superior Court of Arizona in
Maricopa County**, the state's largest court by caseload, serving
Phoenix and the balance of Maricopa County.

## Facilities

Maricopa County Superior Court is multi-campus. The downtown
Phoenix complex and several regional centers host civil
operations:

- **Central Court Building (CCB)** and the **East Court Building
  (ECB)** — the downtown Phoenix civil complex; the Clerk of the
  Superior Court's central filing counter and the bulk of civil
  judicial officers sit here.
- **Old Courthouse** — the historic downtown building used for
  certain calendars and ceremonial proceedings.
- **Northeast Regional Court Center** and **Southeast Regional
  Court Center** — regional facilities (Mesa / east-valley area)
  that hear civil and family matters.
- **Northwest Regional Court Center** — Surprise (west-valley
  area).

Confirm the current building, civil-filing counter, and the
calendar assigned to your case with the Clerk of the Superior
Court before any in-person filing or appearance; facility
assignments and hours change.

## General civil jurisdiction

The Superior Court is Arizona's court of **general jurisdiction**
and hears civil actions without a statutory amount-in-controversy
ceiling, plus equitable claims and other matters within superior
court jurisdiction. Lower-value money claims and many
landlord-tenant and small-claims matters belong in the **Justice
Courts** — see `az-justice-courts`. Confirm the jurisdictional and
venue fit before filing; a misfiled case can be transferred or
dismissed.

## Local rules

Practice in this court is governed by the statewide **Arizona
Rules of Civil Procedure** as supplemented by the **Local Rules of
Practice for the Superior Court in Maricopa County** and the
court's standing **administrative orders**. The local rules
address civil case management, the compulsory-arbitration program,
complex-case designation, and motion and calendar practice.

Do not hard-code rule numbers or dollar thresholds from memory —
the local-rule provisions cited below are pointers; **verify the
controlling rule number, current threshold, and any amendment
against the corpus** (`az-law-references`) and the court's
published local rules before relying on them.

## Compulsory arbitration

Maricopa County operates a **compulsory (court-annexed)
arbitration** program under its local rules and the statewide
arbitration provisions of the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure. A
civil money case at or below the **local jurisdictional limit**
(in which no party seeks affirmative relief other than a money
judgment) is routed to a court-appointed arbitrator rather than
tried to the assigned judge in the first instance.

- The complaint is generally accompanied by a **Certificate of
  Compulsory Arbitration** stating whether the controversy is at
  or below the arbitration limit. A case seeking an award above
  the limit is certified **not** subject to arbitration.
- A party dissatisfied with the arbitrator's award may **appeal
  for a trial de novo** before the assigned judge within the
  time set by rule.
- The **arbitration jurisdictional dollar limit, the certificate
  requirement, and the appeal deadline are set by the local rule
  and the Rules of Civil Procedure — confirm the current figures
  against `az-law-references`** rather than treating any number
  here as fixed. (Maricopa's limit has historically been at the
  higher end among Arizona counties; verify the controlling
  amount.)

## Commercial Court

Maricopa County operates a **Commercial Court** — a specialty
civil calendar created as an Arizona Supreme Court pilot in 2015
and made a **permanent feature of the Civil Department effective
January 1, 2019** — to manage commercial and business disputes
expeditiously before a small group of designated judges.

- Eligibility turns on the **nature of the dispute** (commercial
  and business controversies — among business entities and their
  owners, governance, transactions, and related categories), as
  defined by the controlling administrative order; confirm the
  current eligibility definition and any opt-in / assignment
  mechanics in that order.
- Commercial Court cases filed in the **Northeast and Southeast**
  regional facilities are assigned to one of the designated
  Commercial Court judges (who sit downtown). Confirm the current
  assignment procedure with the clerk.
- For substantive commercial-dispute drafting, see
  `az-commercial-disputes`.

Distinct from Commercial Court, the local rules also allow a case
to be designated **complex** (continuous judicial management) on a
party's request granted by the judge or on the judge's own motion,
with reassignment to a Complex Case judge. Confirm the current
complex-designation rule and procedure in the local rules.

## E-filing — AZTurboCourt / eFileAZ

Electronic filing in Maricopa County civil cases runs through the
statewide **AZTurboCourt / eFileAZ** system. E-filing is the
default channel for represented parties and most civil document
types; confirm whether your document type and party status require
e-filing or permit paper or counter filing, and confirm the
correct document-type / case-category selection at upload. See
`az-file-packet`.

## Case-type and case-number conventions

A Maricopa County civil case number embeds a **case-type
designator** that signals the case category. Civil actions
generally carry the **"CV"** prefix (e.g., `CV2026-#######`).
Family, probate, and other departments use different prefixes.
Confirm the controlling designator and any local sub-coding for
your specific claim with the Clerk of the Superior Court, and
select the matching case category at e-filing intake.
