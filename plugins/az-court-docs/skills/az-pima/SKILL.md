Use this skill in addition to `az-statewide-format` when the case
is in the **Pima County Superior Court**, seated in **Tucson**.
Pima is Arizona's second-most-populous county, and its Superior
Court is the state's second-largest, high-volume general-civil
trial court after Maricopa.

## Location and divisions

- The Superior Court sits in the **Pima County Superior Court /
  courthouse complex in downtown Tucson**. Confirm the current
  street address, division/courtroom, and any annex or remote
  hearing locations with the Clerk of the Superior Court before
  filing or appearing.
- Superior Court is Arizona's single court of general
  jurisdiction; Pima organizes its civil work into divisions
  presided over by individual judges, with court commissioners
  handling certain matters. Confirm your assigned division and the
  judge's individual practices before noticing anything.
- Family, probate/mental-health, and juvenile matters run on
  separate calendars and rules — see `az-family-court` /
  `az-family-law`. This skill addresses the **general civil** side.

## Jurisdiction

- The Superior Court hears general civil actions; the **Pima
  County Justice Courts** handle lower-value civil claims and
  evictions (see `az-justice-courts`). Confirm the
  amount-in-controversy threshold and any small-claims overlap
  before choosing the forum.
- Equity, special actions, and appeals from the limited-
  jurisdiction courts also lie in Superior Court.

## Lower-value civil routing — FASTAR (not compulsory arbitration)

- Statewide, **A.R.S. § 12-133** and **Ariz. R. Civ. P. 72–77**
  authorize a county Superior Court to require **compulsory
  arbitration** of civil money cases at or below a
  **jurisdictional dollar limit set by local rule**. But Ariz. R.
  Civ. P. 72(a)(2) lets a county instead establish a **Fast Trial
  and Alternative Resolution ("FASTAR") program**, in which case
  the FASTAR Rules apply *instead of* Rules 72–77 within the
  FASTAR limits.
- **Pima County uses FASTAR, not the ordinary compulsory-
  arbitration track.** Lower-value civil cases are routed into
  FASTAR — under which a party elects either a short "fast trial"
  or an arbitration-style alternative-resolution proceeding —
  rather than the Rules 72–77 compulsory-arbitration process used
  in counties like Maricopa.
- **Do not hard-code the dollar figures or the election
  mechanics** — the FASTAR threshold and the residual
  compulsory-arbitration amount are set by Pima local rule and
  revised periodically. Read the current Pima County Superior
  Court local rules in `az-law-references`, and confirm with the
  clerk which track applies to your case and what the controlling
  thresholds are. For the substantive arbitration/ADR framework
  see `az-commercial-disputes` and `az-hearings`.

## Pima County Superior Court local rules

- Beyond the statewide Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure, Pima
  County Superior Court operates under its **own local rules**
  (adopted under the supervision of the Arizona Supreme Court),
  which govern case assignment, motion practice, the FASTAR /
  compulsory-arbitration thresholds, scheduling, and local filing
  conventions.
- Read the current Pima local rules from the corpus in
  `az-law-references` before relying on any page limit, conferral
  requirement, or motion-call procedure. Where the corpus is a
  pointer stub rather than verbatim text, **confirm the current
  rule with the clerk or the court's website**.

## Case-type and case-number conventions

- Pima Superior Court civil case numbers follow Arizona's Superior
  Court pattern — generally a county/court designator, a two- or
  four-digit year, a case-type code, and a sequential number.
  **Confirm the exact case-type code and number format the Pima
  clerk assigns** for your cause of action; the case-type code
  drives docket routing and the arbitration determination.
- Once assigned, the case number anchors the caption per
  `az-statewide-format`. **Do not guess the case-type code** —
  verify it against the Pima clerk's intake practice.

## Case management and scheduling orders

- After the case is at issue, the court manages civil cases through
  **case-management and scheduling orders** setting discovery
  cutoffs, disclosure deadlines (Arizona's Rule 26.1 mandatory
  disclosure), motion and dispositive-motion dates, ADR/arbitration
  milestones, and the trial date.
- **Calendar your obligations from the scheduling order entered in
  your specific case**, not from a generic template, and confirm
  the assigned judge's individual practices, motion-call day, and
  any chambers-copy or lodging requirement. See
  `az-schedule-hearing`, `az-hearings`, and `az-deadlines`.

**Agent behavior:** before drafting a notice of hearing, setting a
page-limited brief, or calendaring a deadline, read the current
Pima County Superior Court local rules in `az-law-references`, the
scheduling order entered in the case, and the assigned judge's
practices. Confirm the FASTAR / compulsory-arbitration thresholds,
motion-call procedure, and any chambers-copy requirement with the
clerk.

## E-filing — AZTurboCourt

- Arizona's statewide electronic-filing platform is
  **AZTurboCourt**. Pima County Superior Court accepts civil
  filings through AZTurboCourt; confirm whether e-filing is
  **mandatory** for your case type and party, the current
  document-type selections, and the filing-fee / fee-waiver
  workflow with the clerk.
- See `az-file-packet` for packet assembly and preflight and
  `az-statewide-format` for the statewide document-format
  requirements.
