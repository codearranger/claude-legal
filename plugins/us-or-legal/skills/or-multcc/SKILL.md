# Multnomah County Circuit Court

Use this skill in addition to `or-statewide-format` when the case
is in the Multnomah County Circuit Court (MCCC). Multnomah is the
largest trial court in Oregon (~25–30% of all civil filings
statewide) and has the most developed local-rule and motion-
practice ecosystem.

## Court locations and divisions

Multnomah Circuit Court has three principal facilities:

- **Central Courthouse** (the new flagship), 1200 SW 1st Ave,
  Portland OR 97204 — civil, criminal felony, family law,
  probate, mandatory arbitration. Opened 2020, replaced the old
  Multnomah County Courthouse.
- **Justice Center**, 1120 SW 3rd Ave, Portland OR 97204 —
  criminal misdemeanor, in-custody criminal arraignments,
  violations
- **Donald E. Long Juvenile Justice Complex** (the "JJC"),
  1401 NE 68th Ave, Portland OR 97213 — juvenile delinquency and
  juvenile dependency

For civil pleadings, the venue is the **Central Courthouse**. The
caption identifies "FOR THE COUNTY OF MULTNOMAH" — there is no
sub-division reference in the caption (unlike KCDC's
East/South/West divisions in Washington).

## Caption — Multnomah variant

```
            IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE STATE OF OREGON
                  FOR THE COUNTY OF MULTNOMAH
```

Case numbers follow `YYCVNNNNN` for civil cases (e.g.,
`25CV12345`). The first two digits are the year; "CV" is the case
type (civil); the remaining digits are the sequential filing
number for the year.

## Civil motion scheduling — chambers contact, not a calendar clerk

Multnomah does **not** use a centralized motions docket. Each
civil case is assigned to a specific judge at filing (via the
Multnomah civil case-assignment system). Motions are heard on
**that judge's individual calendar**. To set a motion:

**Step 1 — Identify the assigned judge**

The assigned judge appears on the OJD Case Information screen for
the case (visible to the parties and in File and Serve once the
case is filed). For a newly filed case where assignment has not
yet posted, check with Civil Division at (503) 988-3022.

**Step 2 — Contact the judge's judicial assistant (JA)**

Email or call the assigned judge's JA to request a hearing date.
The JA roster is published on the Multnomah Circuit Court website
(courts.oregon.gov/multnomah, "Judges and Staff"):

- Pull the current JA name and email from
  https://www.courts.oregon.gov/courts/multnomah/judges/Pages/default.aspx
  before each request — assignments rotate

In the email, identify:

- Case caption and number
- Motion type (e.g., "Motion to Compel under ORCP 46")
- Estimated argument time
- Whether other parties have been consulted on dates
- Two or three proposed dates that work for the moving party

**Step 3 — JA confirms the date**

The JA will reply confirming the date, courtroom, and mode
(in-person, WebEx, or telephone). Some judges hold all civil
motions on WebEx by default; others prefer in-person. Take what
the JA offers.

**Step 4 — File the Notice of Hearing**

After the JA confirms, file a **Notice of Hearing** through File
and Serve, identifying the date, courtroom, mode, and assigned
judge. The Notice of Hearing is what gives the *record* notice
of the setting (the JA's email is internal scheduling, not part
of the court record).

**Step 5 — Working copies to chambers**

For motions over 5 pages (memorandum + exhibits combined), or for
motions where the judge has specifically requested it, deliver
**working copies** to chambers:

- Multnomah SLR 5.100 governs working copies
- Deliver to the judge's courtroom or chambers via the Central
  Courthouse mail room
- The working copy is a tabbed, bound paper copy of the entire
  packet — motion, memorandum, declaration, exhibits, proposed
  order
- For pro se filers, mailing the working copy to the courtroom
  (addressed to the judicial assistant) is acceptable
- Some judges accept email-only working copies for short motions;
  always confirm with the JA when you request the date

## Authoritative source — pull the current judge roster every time

The Multnomah Circuit Court website is the canonical source for
judges, judicial assistants, courtrooms, and standing orders:

**https://www.courts.oregon.gov/courts/multnomah/Pages/default.aspx**

**Agent behavior**: when drafting a Notice of Hearing or working-
copy cover note, fetch the current JA contact info from that
page. Judge rotations occur in January each year (and sometimes
mid-year); do not cache assignments across sessions.

## Multnomah SLR — Supplemental Local Rules

Multnomah's SLR adds detail on top of the statewide UTCR. Key
sections for civil motion practice:

| SLR | Subject |
|-----|---------|
| 1.001 | Effective date and scope |
| 5.015 | Notice of Hearing on Motion |
| 5.025 | Setting motions (chambers-based, by JA) |
| 5.045 | Meet-and-confer certification for discovery motions |
| 5.100 | Working copies — when, how, and where |
| 5.101 | Submission of orders to chambers |
| 7.010 | Telephonic and remote hearings |
| 8.010 | Mandatory arbitration program (under ORS 36.400) |
| 12.010 | Pretrial conferences and trial readiness |
| 14.010 | Mediation referrals |

The current Multnomah SLR PDF lives at
https://www.courts.oregon.gov/courts/multnomah/rules — pull it
when a specific SLR section is invoked, because Multnomah updates
its SLRs more frequently than other counties.

## Mandatory arbitration

ORS 36.400 et seq. requires arbitration for civil cases where
the amount in controversy is between $10,000 and $50,000 (the
ceiling is set by ORS 36.405 and is currently $50,000 statewide;
Multnomah elects the statutory ceiling). Multnomah SLR 8.010
implements this.

If the case is in arbitration:

- Discovery is limited (see arbitration program rules)
- Motions go to the arbitrator, not the judge — caption the
  motion accordingly: "MOTION TO COMPEL... (IN ARBITRATION
  PROCEEDING UNDER ORS 36.400)"
- A trial de novo can be requested after the arbitration award
  per ORS 36.425, but only after fees are paid

## eFiling and service

Multnomah requires eFiling for all civil matters through File and
Serve (https://oregon.tylertech.cloud). Document codes are
specific:

- Motion → "Motion (Other)" or "Motion to [Type]" if listed
- Memorandum → "Memorandum in Support of Motion"
- Declaration → "Declaration of [Name]"
- Notice of Hearing → "Notice of Hearing"
- Proposed Order → "Order — Proposed"

Service through eService (File and Serve) counts as service for
registered parties (UTCR 21.100, ORCP 9 G(1)(d)). Self-
represented parties not registered must be served by mail or hand
delivery — see `or-pro-se` for the protocol.

## Filing fees

Multnomah civil filing fees track the OJD statewide schedule
under ORS 21.135-21.170:

- Complaint or counterclaim over $10,000: $281 (subject to
  legislative update — pull current fee from
  https://www.courts.oregon.gov/services/fees/Pages/default.aspx)
- Motion: $11 per side per motion (some motion types are free —
  see ORS 21.260)
- Fee waiver: ORS 21.682 (filing-fee deferral); ORS 20.140 (in
  forma pauperis status)

Fee-waiver applications are filed simultaneously with the
underlying pleading on File and Serve; the fee is deferred
pending the court's order on the application.

## Document set for a noted motion in Multnomah

1. **Motion** (primary relief sought)
2. **Memorandum in Support** (if argument is more than 1 page)
3. **Supporting Declaration(s)** with exhibits
4. **Proposed Order** ("[PROPOSED]" bracket in title)
5. **Notice of Hearing** (filed separately after JA confirms
   date)
6. **Certificate of Service** (separately or as a page in each
   document)
7. **Working copies to chambers** (for motions over 5 pages or
   where the judge requests)

eFile each as a separate PDF through File and Serve. Working
copies are delivered separately (paper or email per the JA's
preference).
