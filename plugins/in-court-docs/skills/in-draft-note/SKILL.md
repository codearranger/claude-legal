# Draft an Indiana Notice of Hearing / Notice of Setting

In Indiana civil practice, the scheduling document that places a
motion before the court is called a **Notice of Hearing** or a
**Notice of Setting**. The terminology and procedure differ from
Washington's "Note for Motion Calendar" or California's "Notice
of Motion."

The Indiana practice in most counties:

1. The movant files the motion + memorandum + declaration +
   proposed order
2. **The court** (judicial assistant or bailiff) reviews the
   filing and issues a **Notice of Setting** designating the
   date, time, and location of the hearing
3. The Notice of Setting is served on all parties via Odyssey

In some counties (Hamilton, Allen, Vanderburgh), the movant must
request a setting; in Marion Civil Division, the court typically
sets non-evidentiary motions for ruling on the briefs without
oral argument unless argument is requested. The Notice of
Hearing scaffolded here is filed when the party requests a
specific hearing date OR when the court has not yet acted and
the party wants to expedite.

## Two scheduling-document patterns

### Pattern 1: Notice of Hearing (party-issued)

Used when the party requests oral argument on a pending motion
and proposes a hearing date. T.R. 73(C):

> "If a hearing is requested, the request shall be in writing
> and shall set forth a brief statement of the nature of the
> hearing requested."

```

### Pattern 2: Request for Setting (party-issued, court completes)

Used when the party files a motion and asks the court to set a
hearing date. The party leaves the date / time / courtroom
blanks for the court to fill in.

```

## How the assigned courtroom routes the setting

In Marion Civil Division:

1. Motion filed via Odyssey
2. Judicial assistant docket-checks within 1-3 business days
3. JA emails parties with proposed date(s), or issues an Order
   Setting Hearing
4. Court enters the Order Setting Hearing; Odyssey serves all
   parties

In Lake County Civil Division 5 (Hammond):

1. Motion filed via Odyssey
2. JA may set the hearing automatically based on the case-
   management standing order
3. Notice of Setting issued by the court

In county Circuit Courts:

1. Motion filed via Odyssey
2. Parties typically call chambers or email the JA to discuss
   available dates
3. Setting order issued by the court

## Hearing types — what to specify

| Hearing type | Typical duration | Set for ... |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| Status conference | 10-20 min | Marion CMS conferences |
| Pretrial conference | 30-60 min | After discovery complete |
