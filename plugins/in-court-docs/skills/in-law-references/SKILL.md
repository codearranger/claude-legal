# Indiana Law References — Canonical Catalog

This is the matter-neutral reference catalog for Indiana civil
practice. It indexes every authoritative source the other
in-court-docs skills cite. Treat this as the **library** that the
rest of the plugin pulls from. The substantive reference content
itself lives under `references/` in this skill and the dependency
plugin `claude-legal-federal-laws`.

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Generated content is a drafting aid;
> verify against the most current Indiana Trial Rules and
> Indiana Code before filing — rules and statutes are amended
> annually.

## The five pillars of Indiana civil practice law

1. **Indiana Trial Rules** (Ind. Trial R. / T.R.) — adopted by
   the Indiana Supreme Court in 1970, patterned after the Federal
   Rules of Civil Procedure with Indiana-specific deviations
   (e.g., T.R. 56 burden allocation; T.R. 59 motion to correct
   error). Published at `courts.in.gov/rules/trial_proc/`.
2. **Indiana Rules of Evidence** (Ind. Evid. R. / IRE) — adopted
   in 1994; tracks the Federal Rules of Evidence with Indiana
   carve-outs.
3. **Indiana Code** (IC) — the statutory law of Indiana, organized
   into 36 titles. Civil-procedure-relevant titles: IC 1
   (Sovereignty), IC 13 (Environment), IC 23 (Business), IC 24
   (Trade Regulation, including IC 24-4.5 IUCCC and IC 24-5-0.5
   DCSA), IC 26 (Commercial Law / UCC enactment), IC 32 (Real
   Property), IC 33 (Courts and Judicial Procedure), IC 34
   (Civil Procedure), IC 35 (Criminal Law and Procedure), IC 36
   (Local Government).
4. **Indiana Supreme Court Rules** — includes the Rules of
   Appellate Procedure (Ind. App. R.), the Indiana Administrative
   Rules (Ind. Admin. R.), the Rules for Admission to the Bar
   (Ind. Admis. Disc. R.), and the Rule on Citation (within the
   Admission, Discipline, and Citation Rules).
5. **Local Rules** — every county adopts a local rule set under
   the prefix `LR[county-code]`. Marion = LR49, Lake = LR45,
   Hamilton = LR29, etc.
