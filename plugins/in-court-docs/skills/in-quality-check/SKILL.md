# Quality Check — Indiana Court Documents

This skill is the **final pre-filing review** — the last
checkpoint between drafting and filing. It runs a four-pass
quality control protocol: format compliance, content review,
upload-readiness, and pro-se conduct review. The output is a
go / no-go decision plus a defect log.

The format-check.py script bundled with this plugin is the
computational counterpart for the format-compliance pass.

## QC sequence — four passes

```
Pass 1 (Format): T.R. 5(E) compliance + venue local-rule format
Pass 2 (Content): Citation accuracy, internal consistency,
                  packet integrity (cross-references)
Pass 3 (Upload):  Odyssey readiness — document codes, PDF
                  structure, file size, Service Contacts
Pass 4 (Pro Se):  Signature, contact info, service list,
                  T.R. 11(A) requirements

If all four pass: GO
If any blocks: NO-GO with defect log
```

## Pass 1 — Format compliance (T.R. 5(E))

Run `scripts/format-check.py` on the `.docx` (or PDF rasterized
from the .docx). Checks:

- [ ] Paper size: 8.5 × 11 inches (Letter)
- [ ] Margins: top page-1 ≥ 2 inches (for clerk's stamp); other
      pages ≥ 1 inch on all sides
- [ ] Font: 12 pt minimum; serif body (Times New Roman, Cambria,
      Century Schoolbook, etc.)
- [ ] Line spacing: double-spaced body (T.R. 5(E)(3));
      single-spacing allowed for block quotations, footnotes,
      captions, signature blocks
- [ ] Page numbers: bottom of every page (T.R. 5(E)(4))
- [ ] Footer: contains PAGE and NUMPAGES fields; includes
      document short title and / or cause number per local rule

Venue-specific format additions:

- **Marion (LR49-TR5-203)**: chambers-copy threshold at 15 pages
- **Lake (LR45-TR5)**: chambers-copy threshold at 20 pages
- **Hamilton (LR29-TR5)**: chambers-copy threshold at 15 pages
- All venues: Indiana Administrative Rule 9 confidentiality
  designation if the filing contains protected information

## Pass 2 — Content review

Delegates to `in-fact-check` for the four sub-passes:

1. **Citation verification** — every rule, statute, case cite
   verified against canonical sources
2. **Internal consistency** — captions, cause numbers, party
   names, dates aligned throughout
3. **Packet consistency** — declarations support memo arguments;
   exhibit list matches attached exhibits; proposed order matches
   relief
4. **Sworn-vs.-argued consistency** — every factual assertion
   has a sworn predicate or is identified as legal argument

Specific Indiana-specific checks:

- [ ] Caption uses **STATE OF INDIANA** + COURT NAME + COUNTY +
      INDIANA top block
- [ ] **"v."** (not "vs.") between parties
- [ ] Cause number county-code matches the named county
- [ ] Citation format: `Smith v. Jones, 123 N.E.3d 456 (Ind.
      2023)` — reporter + page + court + year
- [ ] Rule citations: `Ind. Trial R. 56(C)` or `T.R. 56(C)`
- [ ] Statute citations: `IC 34-11-2-9` (no "§" required)
- [ ] No reference to "ORS" / "RCW" / "C.R.S." / "Cal. Civ. Code"
      (other state remnants — common search-and-replace error)
- [ ] No reference to "in pro per" (California-ism) — use
      "Pro Se"

## Pass 3 — Odyssey upload readiness

- [ ] PDF rendered correctly (not the .docx)
- [ ] File size under 25 MB (single document)
- [ ] If multi-document filing, total under 100 MB
- [ ] Document code identified in advance (see Marion / Lake
      document code references)
- [ ] All exhibits bookmarked in the PDF (if combined PDF)
- [ ] Service Contacts up to date for the case
- [ ] Filing fee identified or fee waiver filed
- [ ] No restricted information (SSN, account numbers) — use
      "XXX-XX-XXXX" redaction format
- [ ] Indiana Administrative Rule 9 confidentiality designation
      if applicable

## Pass 4 — Pro se conduct review

- [ ] Signature on the last page (wet or `/s/` for e-filing)
- [ ] "Pro Se" designation after name (not "in pro per")
- [ ] Mailing address, phone, email all current
- [ ] Email matches the Odyssey Service Contacts entry
- [ ] No Attorney Number on the signature block (Atty. No. is
      for licensed attorneys only)
- [ ] Certificate of Service in the body listing service method
      for each party
- [ ] Verification language (if required) uses the IC 35-44.1-
      2-1 formula: "I affirm, under the penalties for perjury,
      that the foregoing representations are true."

## Defect-severity scale

| Severity | Effect | Examples |
|----------|--------|----------|
| BLOCKING | Filing rejected by clerk or court | Wrong cause number; missing signature; PDF corrupted |
| HIGH | Likely to draw an order to refile | Wrong margins; missing proposed order; missing Certificate of Service |
| MEDIUM | Court may rule despite defect, but quality suffers | Citation format errors; inconsistent date references |
| LOW | Style only; no procedural impact | Em-dash vs. hyphen; minor typo |
| INFO | Improvement suggestion | Stronger case cite available |
