# Indiana Case Deadlines

This skill computes every deadline in Indiana civil practice
using Trial Rule 6 time-computation rules and IC 1-1-9-1 state
holidays. It is invoked anytime a deadline must be calculated —
whether from a service date, a hearing date, a judgment entry
date, or a statutory accrual.

The bundled `scripts/case-calendar.py` is the computational
counterpart; it encodes all named Indiana deadline rules and
returns the exact next-business-day adjustment. Use it for every
non-trivial deadline.

## Trial Rule 6 — Time Computation

T.R. 6(A) sets the standard time-computation rules:

> "In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these
> rules, by order of the court, or by any applicable statute, the
> day of the act, event, or default from which the designated
> period of time begins to run shall not be included. The last
> day of the period so computed is to be included unless it is:
> (1) a Saturday, (2) a Sunday, (3) a legal holiday as defined by
> state statute, or (4) a day the office in which the act is to
> be done is closed during regular business hours. ..."

Key rules:

1. **Exclude Day 0** (the triggering event)
2. **Include the last day** UNLESS it is a weekend or IC 1-1-9-1
   legal holiday — in which case extend to the next non-holiday
   weekday
3. For periods of **less than 7 days**, intermediate Saturdays,
   Sundays, and legal holidays are EXCLUDED from the count (T.R.
   6(A))
4. For periods of **7 days or more**, intermediate Saturdays /
   Sundays / holidays are INCLUDED in the count

Examples:

- **20-day answer due** (T.R. 6(C)): Served on Monday March 3,
  2025. Day 1 = Tuesday March 4. Day 20 = Sunday March 23. Last
  day Saturday/Sunday → extend to Monday March 24, 2025.
- **5-day notice of deposition** (T.R. 30(B)(1)): less than 7
  days, so intermediate weekends are excluded. Notice served
  Wednesday April 2, 2025 → 5 court days = following Wednesday
  April 9 (skipping Saturday April 5 and Sunday April 6).

## Service-by-mail — no extension under Indiana practice

Important Indiana quirk: **T.R. 6(E) was abolished in 2009**.
Indiana no longer adds 3 days for service by mail; the deadline
runs from the date of service regardless of method. This differs
from federal practice (FRCP 6(d) still adds 3 days for mail
service) and from Oregon (ORCP 10 C adds 3 days for mail).

Practical impact: when a Summons is served by certified mail,
the 20-day answer clock starts on the date the green card is
signed by the defendant. The plaintiff cannot rely on extra mail
days.

## Indiana legal holidays — IC 1-1-9-1

The statewide legal holidays (the days a court office is "closed
during regular business hours" under T.R. 6(A)):

| Holiday | Date | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| New Year's Day | January 1 | Saturday → Friday; Sunday → Monday |
| Martin Luther King Jr. Day | 3rd Monday of January | |
| Lincoln's Birthday | February 12 | Observed but courts open |
| Washington's Birthday / Presidents' Day | 3rd Monday of February | |
| **Good Friday** | Friday before Easter | **Indiana-specific**; most states don't observe |
| **Primary Election Day** | 1st Tuesday after 1st Monday in May, even years | **Indiana-specific**; courts closed in even-year primary years |
| Memorial Day | Last Monday of May | |
| Independence Day | July 4 | Saturday → Friday; Sunday → Monday |
| Labor Day | 1st Monday of September | |
| Columbus Day | 2nd Monday of October | Most state courts closed |
| **General Election Day** | 1st Tuesday after 1st Monday in November, even years | **Indiana-specific**; courts closed in even-year general election years |
| Veterans Day | November 11 | Saturday → Friday; Sunday → Monday |
| Thanksgiving | 4th Thursday of November | |
| Day after Thanksgiving | Friday after Thanksgiving | By Governor's proclamation most years; verify |
| Christmas Day | December 25 | Saturday → Friday; Sunday → Monday |

The bundled `scripts/case-calendar.py` encodes these holidays
including the even-year election quirks.

## Using the case-calendar.py script

```bash
# Answer due — 20 calendar days from service 2025-03-15
python3 plugins/in-court-docs/scripts/case-calendar.py \
  --from 2025-03-15 --rule answer-due

# RFP response from a March 1 service date
python3 plugins/in-court-docs/scripts/case-calendar.py \
  --from 2025-03-01 --rule rfp-response

# 6-year SOL from last payment on a credit card account
python3 plugins/in-court-docs/scripts/case-calendar.py \
  --from 2019-11-15 --rule sol-open-account

# Custom — 14 calendar days, manual override
python3 plugins/in-court-docs/scripts/case-calendar.py \
  --from 2025-04-15 --days 14 --mode calendar

# List all named rules
python3 plugins/in-court-docs/scripts/case-calendar.py --rules
```

The script handles end-of-period rollover to the next non-holiday
business day, even-year election holidays, and Good Friday.
