  past". Computes court-day and calendar-day deadlines under ORCP
  10 using ORS 187.010 holidays (with Saturday→Friday /

# Oregon Case Deadlines

This skill computes deadlines in Oregon civil cases — when to
answer, when to file or respond to motions, when to claim
exemptions, when to appeal, and the statutes of limitations
that bound new actions.

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Verify every deadline against the
> current rule and statute. The legislature can amend ORCP and
> ORS without notice.

## How time is computed in Oregon (ORCP 10)

**ORCP 10 A** — Computation:

- **Exclude the day of the triggering event** (the day of
  service, the day of filing, the day of the order)
- **Include the last day** of the period
- **If the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal
  holiday**, the period extends to the next business day

**ORCP 10 B** — Intermediate weekends and holidays:

- **Periods less than 7 days**: exclude weekends and holidays
- **Periods of 7 days or longer**: include weekends and
  holidays

**ORCP 10 C** — 3-day mail rule:

- When service is by mail, **3 additional days** are added to
  any prescribed response period
- Applies only when the triggering act was service by mail; not
  if the triggering act was filing or order

### Oregon legal holidays (ORS 187.010)

| Holiday | Date |
|---------|------|
| New Year's Day | January 1 |
| Martin Luther King, Jr. Day | 3rd Monday of January |
| Presidents' Day | 3rd Monday of February |
| Memorial Day | Last Monday of May |
| Juneteenth | June 19 |
| Independence Day | July 4 |
| Labor Day | 1st Monday of September |
| Veterans Day | November 11 |
| Thanksgiving Day | 4th Thursday of November |
| Christmas Day | December 25 |

**Observed-day rule** (ORS 187.020):

- Saturday holiday → observed on the preceding Friday
- Sunday holiday → observed on the following Monday

Note: Oregon does NOT recognize the day after Thanksgiving as a
statewide holiday (unlike Washington). Some Oregon counties may
treat it as a courthouse closure day; verify locally.

## Deterministic computation

Use the bundled `scripts/case-calendar.py` for date arithmetic:

```bash
# Compute the answer deadline — 30 calendar days from service
# on 2025-04-15
python3 plugins/or-court-docs/scripts/case-calendar.py \
  --from 2025-04-15 --rule answer-due

# Compute a custom deadline — 14 court days after a given date
python3 plugins/or-court-docs/scripts/case-calendar.py \
  --from 2025-04-15 --days 14 --mode court

# List all known rules
python3 plugins/or-court-docs/scripts/case-calendar.py --rules
```

The script encodes ORCP 10 A/B/C and ORS 187.010/.020 exactly,
so the computation is deterministic.

## The 3-day mail rule, in practice

ORCP 10 C adds 3 days to any response period when service was
by mail. This rule trips up many practitioners. Examples:

- **Discovery response served by mail on April 1**: response
  due 30 + 3 = 33 days from April 1, i.e., **May 4**
- **Discovery response served by eService on April 1**:
  response due 30 days, i.e., **May 1** (no mail-rule
  addition; eService is electronic, not mail)
- **Motion served by mail on April 1**: response due
  [local SLR period] + 3 days from April 1

eService through File and Serve does NOT trigger the 3-day mail
rule. The 3-day rule applies only to actual paper mail under
ORCP 9 B (USPS).

## Computing examples

### Example 1: Answer to complaint

Defendant is personally served on **Wednesday, April 15, 2025**.

ORCP 7 C(2) — 30 calendar days to answer.

Day 1 = April 16 (day after service).
30 days from April 15, counting day 1 = April 16, is May 15.

May 15 is a Thursday — a business day. **Answer due May 15,
2025.**

### Example 2: Motion to compel with meet-and-confer

Discovery response served by **eService on Friday, May 16,
2025**. The response objects to RFPs 3, 5, 6.

ORCP 43 B — 30 days. No mail-rule addition (eService).

May 16 + 30 days = June 15. June 15 is a Sunday → next
business day. **Original response was timely; no extension to
the requesting party.**

Defendant decides to meet and confer. Meet-and-confer letter
sent **Monday, May 19, 2025**. Reasonable response window of
14 days = **Monday, June 2, 2025.**

If opposing party fails to supplement by June 2, motion to
compel can be filed.

### Example 3: SJ schedule

Trial date: **Monday, August 25, 2025.**

ORCP 47 C — motion filed at least 60 days before trial.

60 days before August 25 = June 26 (Thursday). **SJ motion
must be filed by June 26, 2025.**

Response due 20 days after service of motion. If motion was
filed and served on June 26, response due **July 16, 2025**.

Reply due 5 days after service of response. If response was
served on July 16, reply due **July 21, 2025.**

Hearing must be at least 11 days after filing of reply. If
reply was filed July 21, hearing must be on or after **August
1, 2025.**

(Use the calendar script to verify and adjust for any
intervening holidays.)

### Example 4: Notice of Appeal

Judgment entered **Tuesday, June 3, 2025.**

ORS 19.255 — 30 days from entry of judgment to file Notice of
Appeal.

June 3 + 30 days = July 3 (Thursday — Independence Day-1).
July 3 is a business day; July 4 is a holiday.

**Notice of Appeal due July 3, 2025.** (If June 3 were a
Friday, the deadline could fall on a weekend and extend.)

## Common deadline-computation mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Including the day of the triggering event | Off-by-one; missed deadline |
| Forgetting the 3-day mail rule | Short-served response is treated as timely; surprise |
| Adding 3 days for eService | Not required; can backfire if you over-rely |
| Counting weekends in periods < 7 days | Over-counts; ORCP 10 B excludes intermediate weekends for short periods |
| Forgetting to extend if last day is weekend/holiday | Off-by-one; missed deadline |
| Confusing court days and calendar days | "Days" in ORCP is calendar unless specified court |
| Confusing observe-day rule | Saturday Independence Day observed on prior Friday; Sunday observed on following Monday |

## When in doubt, file early

When the deadline is close, file early. Late filings can be
fatal — ORCP 21 motions, Notice of Appeal, Motion to Vacate,
etc., are all strict deadlines and missing them is not curable
through the doctrine of substantial compliance.

For pro se filers: build a buffer. Aim for filings 5–7 days
before the deadline; that leaves room for technology issues,
clerk rejection, or last-minute corrections.
