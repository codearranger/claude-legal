# Pro Se Drafting for Oregon Courts

Use this skill when drafting court documents for a pro se
litigant in an Oregon circuit court. It encodes the Brian Parker
(KillDebt.com) drafting framework adapted to Oregon procedural
conventions and the practical service and filing protocols pro
se filers need.

## The Parker framework

Every motion and declaration follows four principles:

1. **Front-load the strongest facts.** The judge should know the
   best fact in the case within the first paragraph. Do not bury
   it under procedural history.
2. **Keep motions concise.** Target 4–6 pages for a motion +
   memorandum. Use bold lead-ins to let the judge skim. Every
   sentence earns its place.
3. **Write to the judge, not to opposing counsel.** Avoid ad
   hominem. Let the record speak. State facts; let the judge
   draw the characterizations.
4. **Let the record speak.** Attach the documents that prove the
   point and cite to them by exhibit number and page. A well-
   indexed record is worth more than rhetoric.

## Signature block for pro se (Oregon)

```
____________________________________
[Full Name]
Defendant, pro se
[Street Address]
[City, OR ZIP]
[Phone]
[Email]
```

- Use **"pro se"** (Oregon convention, same as Washington)
- **Omit OSB number** — that's for licensed Oregon attorneys.
  Including a fake OSB# is grounds for sanctions and could
  qualify as unauthorized practice of law (ORS 9.160).
- Include phone (required for chambers contact)
- Include email (most courts and opposing counsel serve
  electronically by default)
- For declarations, also include the perjury clause (ORCP 1 E)
  above the signature

## Service protocol — Oregon

### Initial summons and complaint (ORCP 7)

If you (as plaintiff) are filing a new case, the summons and
complaint must be served per ORCP 7 — File and Serve cannot
serve initial process. Hire a process server or sheriff for
personal service unless the defendant has agreed in writing to
accept service by mail.

### Subsequent filings (ORCP 9, UTCR 21.100)

After the initial complaint, all subsequent filings are served
under ORCP 9. Acceptable methods:

- **eService through File and Serve** — for parties registered
  for eService (most attorneys, some pro se litigants)
- **Email** — if the parties agreed in writing or the receiving
  party has eService registered
- **Mail (USPS first-class)** — universally acceptable
- **Hand delivery** — universally acceptable

Pro se filers without eService access should serve by **both**
email and certified mail (USPS Certified with Return Receipt, or
Priority Mail with tracking) — belt and suspenders.

### Service best practices for pro se

1. **Photograph postmarked envelopes before opening** any
   incoming mail from the court or opposing counsel — date of
   postmark is sometimes important
2. **Memorialize every oral or phone interaction** with opposing
   counsel in writing immediately after it happens (a short
   email "to confirm our call today" is a contemporaneous
   record)
3. **Keep a complete filing log** — date, filing, service
   method, recipient
4. **Use certified mail** whenever opposing counsel has a
   documented history of false Certificates of Service
5. **Include a Certificate of Service (UTCR 1.090)** with every
   filing, signed and dated

## Common pro se pitfalls — Oregon-specific

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Overlong motions | Cap at 6 pages; move narrative to declarations |
| Emotional tone | Rewrite as neutral fact statements; let the judge characterize |
| Missing relief clause | Every motion ends with a clear "RELIEF REQUESTED" section |
| Citing exhibits without attaching | Always attach, index, and label with exhibit numbers (NOT letters — Oregon convention) |
| Forgetting the ORCP 1 E perjury clause | Every declaration needs the "I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Oregon..." clause |
| Colored or highlighted text | Violates UTCR 2.010 — use bold/italic for emphasis |
| Missing Notice of Hearing | Most counties require a Notice of Hearing to set the motion on calendar |
| Ambiguous signature block | Always include name, "pro se" designation, address, phone, email — NO OSB# |
| Trying to serve interrogatories | **Oregon does not permit interrogatories under ORCP without a court order.** Use RFPs (ORCP 43) and depositions instead. See `or-discovery`. |
| Citing "CR 12(b)(6)" | Use **ORCP 21 A(8)** — Oregon's analog to FRCP 12(b)(6) |
| Citing "RCW" or Washington rules | Oregon uses **ORS** (Oregon Revised Statutes), not RCW |
| Using "vs." | Oregon uses **"v."** (with period) — not "vs." |
| Lettered exhibits (A, B, C) | Oregon convention is **numbered** (1, 2, 3) |
| Filing federal-style citations | Oregon Style Manual uses no periods in "Or", "Or App", "P3d", "USC", "CFR" |

## Drafting checklist (run before filing)

- [ ] Caption is complete and matches the case number exactly
- [ ] Court header uses "IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE STATE OF
      OREGON" + "FOR THE COUNTY OF [COUNTY]"

- [ ] First paragraph states the single most important fact
- [ ] Every factual assertion is supported by an exhibit or
      sworn statement
- [ ] Motion ≤ 6 pages; longer content moved to declaration
- [ ] Relief requested is spelled out at the end
- [ ] Perjury clause (ORCP 1 E form) present on all declarations
- [ ] Signature block includes name, pro se designation,
      address, phone, email — NO OSB#
- [ ] Footer shows document title and "Page X of Y" on every
      page
- [ ] UTCR 2.010 compliant (3″ top margin page 1, 1″ elsewhere,
      no color)
- [ ] Certificate of Service attached with date and method
- [ ] All exhibits listed, cover-paged, and referenced in the
      body by **number** (not letter)
- [ ] Confidential personal info redacted per UTCR 2.120 (SSN
      last 4 only, etc.)
