# Oregon Law References — General Civil Practice

This skill is a matter-neutral reference index — a pointer to the
statutes, rules, and doctrines most often invoked in Oregon civil
practice *across any subject matter*. The body below summarizes
each source. Detailed sections, elements, and citation examples
live in `references/`.

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** These notes are drafting aids, not legal
> advice. Every citation should be verified against the current
> ORS, current court rule, or current case law before it goes
> into a filing. Use `or-fact-check` before any packet is filed.

## How to use this skill

Ask: *what is the user trying to establish procedurally?*

- **A procedural motion** (compel, dismiss, strike, default, SJ,
  vacate) → start with `references/civil-rules.md`
- **An evidentiary objection** (hearsay, authentication, best
  evidence, foundation) → start with `references/evidence-rules.md`
- **A fee-and-cost request or objection** → start with
  `references/fees-and-costs.md`
- **A local-rule question** (Multnomah SLR; Washington Co SLR) →
  start with `references/local-rules.md`
- **Citation format** → `references/citation-format.md`
- **Canonical URL or citation verification** → start with
  `references/online-sources.md` and hand off to `or-fact-check`
  for per-filing verification
- **Programmatic / structured lookup** (ORS XML, USC XML, eCFR
  API, CourtListener for cite-checking, bulk extraction, change
  detection) → `references/legal-data-apis.md`. Prefer the APIs
  listed there over HTML scraping when the result will be parsed
- **A general civil case** (SJ standard, lodestar, default-
  vacation) → start with `references/key-cases.md`
- **Subject-matter law** (FDCPA, Reg F, consumer protection
  under UTPA, landlord-tenant, family, PI, criminal) → use the
  relevant subject-matter skill (e.g., `or-consumer-debt` for
  debt collection)

## Oregon civil rules

A **single** set of rules — there is no Oregon analog to
Washington's CR / CRLJ split, because Oregon consolidated its
trial courts in 1998.

- **ORCP** — Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure (adopted by the
  Council on Court Procedures under ORS 1.735, with legislative
  approval / non-disapproval)

Key rules:

- **ORCP 1** — applicability; ORCP 1 E permits declarations
  "under penalty of perjury" in lieu of notarized affidavits
- **ORCP 7** — service of summons and complaint; 63-day deadline
  for Return of Service (ORCP 7 D(3))
- **ORCP 9** — service of subsequent papers; ORCP 9 C: 3-day
  mail rule; ORCP 9 G: Certificate of Service
- **ORCP 10** — time computation; defines court days vs.
  calendar days
- **ORCP 15** — pleadings allowed; 30 days to answer (ORCP 7
  C(2))
- **ORCP 17** — signing of pleadings; sanctions for unfounded
  filings
- **ORCP 21** — motions to dismiss / defenses asserted as
  motions; ORCP 21 A(8) = failure to state ultimate facts (the
  Oregon analog to FRCP 12(b)(6))
- **ORCP 23** — amendment of pleadings; "leave shall be freely
  given"
- **ORCP 36** — general scope of discovery; ORCP 36 B(1) =
  relevance + proportionality
- **ORCP 39** — depositions
- **ORCP 43** — requests for production
- **ORCP 44** — physical/mental examination
- **ORCP 45** — requests for admission
- **ORCP 46** — motion to compel; **ORCP 46 A(4)(a)** =
  mandatory fee-shifting on a successful motion to compel
- **ORCP 47** — summary judgment; ORCP 47 C governs filing /
  response / reply schedule
- **ORCP 54** — dismissal; ORCP 54 B = failure to prosecute
- **ORCP 67** — judgments
- **ORCP 68** — costs; **ORCP 68 C(2)–(4)** = statement of
  costs and fees procedure
- **ORCP 69** — default
- **ORCP 71** — relief from judgment or order; the Oregon
  analog to FRCP 60(b)
- **ORCP 81** — interpretation

**Note**: Oregon does **NOT have written interrogatories** under
ORCP as a matter of right. Discovery tools available are:
depositions (ORCP 39), requests for production (ORCP 43),
physical/mental exams (ORCP 44), and requests for admission
(ORCP 45). Some court-annexed arbitration programs allow
interrogatories under arbitrator's discretion. This is a major
distinction from Washington (which has CR 33 interrogatories)
and from the FRCP (which has FRCP 33).

See `references/civil-rules.md` for rule-by-rule coverage.

## Oregon Evidence Code (OEC)

The OEC is codified in **ORS 40.010–40.585**. Numbering parallels
the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) at the section level (OEC
401 = relevance; OEC 801 = hearsay definition; OEC 901 =
authentication), but the substantive rules sometimes diverge.

Key sections for civil practice:

- **OEC 401** — relevance
- **OEC 403** — exclusion for prejudice / confusion
- **OEC 602** — personal knowledge
- **OEC 801–803** — hearsay; **OEC 803(6)** = business records
- **OEC 901–902** — authentication; **OEC 902** =
  self-authentication
- **OEC 1001–1008** — best evidence; **OEC 1002** = original
  document rule

See `references/evidence-rules.md` for rule-by-rule coverage and
the business-records / authentication patterns most common in
civil practice.

## Fees and costs

**ORS Ch. 20** — the costs and fees chapter. Recovery mechanisms:

- **ORS 20.075** — factors considered in awarding fees (when fees
  are authorized by statute or contract)
- **ORS 20.077** — fees on a per-claim basis
- **ORS 20.082** — small claims fees
- **ORS 20.083** — fees as costs vs. as part of judgment
- **ORS 20.096** — reciprocal fee-shifting in contract cases
  (when contract has one-sided fee clause, prevailing party of
  either side recovers)
- **ORS 20.105** — fee award against party for objectively
  unreasonable position (rough analog to CR 11 in Washington /
  Rule 11 federal — but distinct standard)
- **ORS 20.140** — in forma pauperis status
- **ORS 20.180** — costs as taxed
- **ORS 20.190** — prevailing-party fees (mandatory $200–$590
  depending on case type)

**ORCP-based fee-shifting**:

- **ORCP 46 A(4)(a)** — mandatory fee-shifting to the prevailing
  party on a motion to compel, unless the opposing party's
  failure was "substantially justified"
- **ORCP 17** — sanctions for unsigned or unfounded pleadings
- **ORCP 32** — class action attorney fees
- **ORCP 54 E** — fees on dismissed claims

**Statutory fee-shifting** (subject-matter-specific):

- **ORS 646.638(3)** — UTPA: prevailing-party fees mandatory
- **15 USC § 1692k** — FDCPA: prevailing-consumer fees mandatory
- **ORS 90.255** — landlord-tenant: prevailing-party fees
  available

See `references/fees-and-costs.md` for full coverage, the
lodestar method, pro-se recovery limits, and pleading templates.

## Local rules

Each Oregon circuit court maintains **Supplemental Local Rules
(SLR)** layered on top of the statewide UTCR and ORCP:

- **Multnomah SLR** — Civil Department: motion practice through
  assigned JA (SLR 5.025), meet-and-confer certification (SLR
  5.045), working copies over 25 pages (SLR 5.100), order
  submission (SLR 5.101)
- **Washington County SLR (Oregon)** — Civil Division scheduling
  (SLR 5.025), simultaneous Notice of Hearing (SLR 5.045),
  meet-and-confer (SLR 5.046), working copies over 15 pages
  (SLR 5.100)
- **Other counties' SLR** — Lane, Marion, Jackson, Deschutes,
  Clackamas, etc.

See `references/local-rules.md` for the full coverage,
inter-county variation, and the interaction with UTCR statewide
formatting.

## Citation format

Oregon uses the **Oregon Appellate Courts Style Manual** (OACSM,
also called the "Oregon Style Manual") published by the OJD.
Form for an Oregon case citation:

> *Smith v. Jones*, 350 Or 1, 250 P3d 100 (2010)

Federal citations are non-Bluebook in Oregon style: `15 USC §
1692k(a)(1)` (no periods in "USC"). See
`references/citation-format.md` for patterns for Oregon and
federal citations, parallel cites, short-form references, and
UTCR / Style-Manual compliance.

## Canonical online sources

`references/online-sources.md` is the AI-agent-friendly catalog
of canonical URLs for:

- Oregon court rules (UTCR, ORCP, OEC, ORAP) — courts.oregon.gov
  and the Council on Court Procedures site
- ORS text — oregonlegislature.gov
- eCFR (for federal regulations)
- Cornell LII (for U.S.C. sections)
- CourtListener and Google Scholar (for case law)
- Multnomah and Washington County SLRs
- OJD eCourt File and Serve (for filing mechanics)

The catalog is the **only approved fetch source** for
verification work. Per the plugin's safety policy, **WebFetch is
the only mechanism used** — no curl, wget, Python requests, or
other bypasses are permitted. See `or-fact-check` for the
per-filing verification workflow.

## Key general-civil cases

`references/key-cases.md` catalogs the general-civil cases this
plugin relies on most:

- **SJ burden**: *Two Two v. Fujitec America, Inc.*, 355 Or 319,
  325 P3d 707 (2014) (no genuine issue of material fact; light
  shifts to non-movant after movant's prima facie showing)
- **SJ inferences favorable to non-movant**: *Jones v. General
  Motors Corp.*, 325 Or 404, 939 P2d 608 (1997)
- **Reciprocal fee-shifting**: *Lemargie v. Johnson*, 212 Or App
  451, 157 P3d 1284 (2007) (ORS 20.096 scope)
- **Lodestar method**: *Strawn v. Farmers Ins. Co. of Oregon*,
  353 Or 210, 297 P3d 439 (2013)
- **American rule baseline / no-fees-without-authority**:
  *Domingo v. Anderson*, 325 Or 385, 938 P2d 206 (1997)
- **ORCP 71 default-vacation**: *Wagar v. Prudential Ins. Co. of
  America*, 276 Or 827, 556 P2d 658 (1976) (excusable neglect
  standard; also discussed in Or App opinions on ORCP 71 B(1))

**Subject-matter cases** — FDCPA, UTPA, business-records
foundation in debt cases, chain-of-title — live alongside their
subject-matter bundle (e.g., `or-consumer-debt/references/
key-cases.md`).

## Notes

- These references are neutral summaries. They do not tell the
  user whether they win or lose.
- Always **verify** a case before citing — Oregon case law has
  evolved on several doctrines (business-records foundation,
  ORCP 71 grounds, fee-shifting scope, ORCP 47 inferences).
- For federal law, check the most recent Ninth Circuit opinion
  where controlling in federal court; Oregon state courts treat
  Ninth Circuit federal-statute interpretations as persuasive.
- **Before filing**, run `or-fact-check` against the packet to
  catch fabricated, misquoted, or superseded citations.
