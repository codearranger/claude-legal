  County — i.e., the circuit courts of the state's other most
  populous counties: Clackamas (Oregon City), Lane (Eugene), Marion
  (Salem), Jackson (Medford), Deschutes (Bend), Linn (Albany),
  Benton (Corvallis), Yamhill (McMinnville), Polk (Dallas), and
  Douglas (Roseburg). Triggers include the county name plus
  "Circuit Court" / "where do I file" / "eFile" / "File and Serve"
  / "local rules" / "civil motion calendar", or a case venued in
  one of those counties. For Multnomah use `or-multcc`; for
  Washington County (Oregon) use `or-wccc`. Layer on top of

# Oregon county circuit courts (non-Multnomah / non-Washington)

Use this skill in addition to `or-statewide-format` when filing
in any Oregon circuit court other than Multnomah County or
Washington County.

Oregon has 36 counties and 27 judicial districts (some districts
combine multiple counties — e.g., the 21st District is Benton
County only; the 22nd District is Crook and Jefferson). Every
county has at least one circuit court courthouse. The high-volume
counties below have their own SLR, judicial assistants, and
established motion practice.

## County / venue table — Oregon's most populous counties (after Multnomah & Washington)

| County | Seat | Courthouse / address | Judicial District | Civil contact |
|--------|------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Clackamas | Oregon City | 807 Main St, Oregon City OR 97045 | 5th | (503) 655-8447 |
| Lane | Eugene | 125 E 8th Ave, Eugene OR 97401 | 2nd | (541) 682-4020 |
| Marion | Salem | 100 High St NE, Salem OR 97301 | 3rd | (503) 588-5105 |
| Jackson | Medford | 100 S Oakdale Ave, Medford OR 97501 | 1st | (541) 776-7171 |
| Deschutes | Bend | 1100 NW Bond St, Bend OR 97703 | 11th | (541) 388-5300 |
| Linn | Albany | 300 SW 4th Ave, Albany OR 97321 | 23rd (with Benton) | (541) 967-3845 |
| Benton | Corvallis | 120 NW 4th St, Corvallis OR 97330 | 21st | (541) 766-6800 |
| Yamhill | McMinnville | 535 NE 5th St, McMinnville OR 97128 | 25th | (503) 434-7470 |

Pull current contacts from the OJD county-court page:
**https://www.courts.oregon.gov/courts/Pages/find-a-court.aspx**

Phone numbers and street addresses change. Verify the current
contact before drafting a date-request email or mailing
working copies.

## Caption — county variant

The court header line uses "FOR THE COUNTY OF [NAME]":

```
            IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE STATE OF OREGON
                  FOR THE COUNTY OF CLACKAMAS
```

Case numbers follow the statewide format (`25CV12345`,
`25SC12345`, etc.) — same across all counties.

## Scheduling models across counties

Oregon counties use one of three motion-scheduling models:

| Model | Counties (typical) | How motions are set |
|-------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Centralized motion docket** | Some smaller counties; varies by year | A single judge hears all civil motions on a rotating week; date reservation through court coordinator |
| **Court-administrator scheduling** | Lane, Marion, Jackson, Deschutes | Civil motions set by Court Administrator or Civil Department clerk |
| **Individual JA** | Multnomah; some larger civil departments in Lane, Marion | Date requested directly to assigned judge's JA |

To determine which model a county uses, look at its SLR Chapter
5 (Motions) and its court website. When in doubt, **call the
Civil Division** of the relevant courthouse.

## Authoritative source — pull the current court page per county

For each county, the canonical source for judges, courtrooms,
JAs, hours, and SLR is:

**https://www.courts.oregon.gov/courts/[county-slug]/Pages/default.aspx**

Examples:
- /courts/clackamas/
- /courts/lane/
- /courts/marion/
- /courts/jackson/
- /courts/deschutes/

Each county page links to its current SLR PDF. Pull the current
PDF before relying on any SLR section.

## Filing fees

Statewide schedule under ORS 21.135-21.170; identical across all
36 counties. Verify against
https://www.courts.oregon.gov/services/fees/Pages/default.aspx

Fee waiver (ORS 21.682) and in forma pauperis (ORS 20.140) apply
identically across counties.

## eFiling

All Oregon circuit courts use **OJD File and Serve** (Tyler
Tech) statewide. Document codes are the same statewide; the
filing user picks the county at filing.

- Portal: https://oregon.tylertech.cloud/
- Self-help page: courts.oregon.gov/services/online/Pages/efile.aspx
- Help line: (855) 642-9748 (Tyler Tech support)
- File size: 25 MB per document; split larger filings

## Mandatory arbitration

ORS 36.400 et seq. applies statewide. Every county uses the OJD
arbitrator panel. The arbitration program differs slightly
across counties in how arbitrators are assigned (random vs.
party selection) — see the county's SLR Chapter 8.

## Document set (typical for any Oregon county)

1. Motion
2. Memorandum in Support (if argument over 1 page)
3. Supporting Declaration(s) with exhibits
4. Proposed Order ("[PROPOSED]" in title)
5. Notice of Hearing
6. Certificate of Service
7. Working copies (for motions over the local SLR threshold)

The set is the same statewide; the **timing** of when the
Notice of Hearing is filed and the **threshold** for working
copies vary by county SLR.
