name: or-quality-check
description: >
  Use this skill when the user asks to QC, review, format-check,
  or otherwise validate an Oregon court document before filing.
  Triggers include "check this document", "QC this", "is this
  UTCR compliant", "format check", "review my motion before I
  file", "run a compliance check", "check my declaration". Runs
  a two-pass check: (1) a UTCR 2.010 **format** pass via
  `scripts/format-check.py` (paper size, margins, fonts, color,
  pagination) and (2) a **content** pass applying the Parker
  framework checklist, citation form, caption accuracy, and
  common pro se red flags. Also auto-detects motion type and
  runs motion-specific checks (ORCP 21, ORCP 46, ORCP 47, ORCP
  71). Composes with `or-statewide-format`, the relevant court
  skill (`or-multcc`, `or-wccc`, `or-county-courts`), and
  `or-pro-se`.

# Quality Check — Format + Content

Run a two-pass quality check on an Oregon court document
before filing.

## Arguments

If the user names a file path, use it. Otherwise, glob the
workspace for recent `.docx` files and ask which one to check.

## Pass 1 — Format check (UTCR 2.010)

1. **Run the checker:**

   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/format-check.py" "<path>"
   ```

2. **Parse output** and summarize:
   - ✅ PASS: item complies
   - ⚠️ WARN: item may deviate; user should verify manually
   - ❌ FAIL: item does not comply; must be fixed

3. **What is checked:**
   - Paper size (Letter: 8.5" × 11")
   - Margins (1" on all sides at minimum; 3" top on page 1 is
     a strong recommendation per UTCR 2.010(2))
   - Line spacing (≥ 1.5 for body)
   - Font family (Times New Roman or similar proportional
     serif)
   - Font size (≥ 12pt in body)
   - No color text, no highlighting (UTCR 2.010 "black or
     blue-black ink only")
   - Footer contains PAGE and NUMPAGES fields (per the
     plugin's footer convention)
   - Numbered paragraphs (if declaration)

4. **For each failure**, explain:
   - What UTCR 2.010 requires
   - Where the deviation is
   - How to fix it (in Word or by regenerating with the
     docx-js template)

## Composition

This skill ALWAYS composes with:

- **`or-statewide-format`** — for the UTCR 2.010
  requirements
- **The relevant court skill** — for local-rule particulars

It typically follows the draft-* skills (which produce the
document) and precedes `or-fact-check` (which verifies the
substantive content).
