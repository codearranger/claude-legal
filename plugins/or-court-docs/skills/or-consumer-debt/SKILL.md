# Oregon Consumer-Debt Defense

This skill is the **subject-matter bundle** for Oregon
consumer-debt litigation: debt-buyer cases, original-creditor
collection actions, and any matter turning on FDCPA / Reg F /
Oregon UTPA / ORS 697.

It assumes the procedural framework is already in place via the
matter-neutral skills. This skill adds:

- **Substantive law**: FDCPA, Reg F, Oregon UTPA, ORS 697
  Collection Agency Registration Act
- **Chain-of-title doctrine**: what a debt-buyer plaintiff
  must prove to recover
- **Evidence patterns**: business-records foundation (OEC
  803(6) / 902(11)) and authentication (OEC 901)
- **Fact-pattern triage**: 5 common debt-defense scenarios
  and the matching defenses / counterclaims
- **Discovery banks**: pre-built RFPs and RFAs targeting the
  weak spots of a debt-buyer's case
- **Example filings**: synthetic answers, declarations,
  motions, and orders for a debt-buyer-defense fact pattern

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Consumer-debt defense is fact-specific
> and outcome-dependent. This skill provides a procedural and
> substantive framework — not strategic advice for any specific
> case.

## Five common Oregon debt-defense fact patterns

### Pattern 1: Debt-buyer suit on an unfamiliar account

Defendant doesn't recognize the account, the account number,
or sometimes the original creditor. Plaintiff is a debt buyer
that purchased a pool of charged-off accounts.

**Defenses commonly raised in this pattern**:

- **Lack of standing** — Plaintiff cannot prove chain of
  title from the original creditor to itself
- **Statute of limitations** — ORS 12.080 6-year SOL may have
  run on the open account
- **Lack of registration** — Plaintiff (if a debt buyer) may
  not be registered with DCBS as required by ORS 697.015
- **OEC 803(6) / 902(11) foundation** — Plaintiff cannot
  authenticate the original creditor's records

**Counterclaims commonly considered in this pattern**:

- **FDCPA** (1692e, 1692f, 1692g) — false representations,
  unfair practices, failure to provide validation
- **Oregon UTPA** (ORS 646.605 et seq.) — equivalent state-law
  claims, often with broader remedies
- **ORS 697.085** — if plaintiff is unregistered

### Pattern 2: Original creditor collection on a known account

Defendant recognizes the account but disputes the amount, the
charges, or the validity of certain transactions.

**Defenses commonly raised in this pattern**:

- **Account stated / objection** — defendant timely disputed
  the account
- **Statute of frauds** (ORS 41.580) — for accounts requiring
  written agreement
- **Fraudulent transactions** — identity theft, unauthorized
  use
- **Statute of limitations** — ORS 12.080
- **Failure of consideration** — for goods/services not
  received

**Counterclaims**:

- **Defamation** — if creditor made false statements to
  credit bureaus
- **FCRA** (15 USC § 1681s-2) — willful or negligent
  furnishing of inaccurate information
- **Oregon UTPA** — for unfair or deceptive collection
  practices

### Pattern 3: Time-barred debt (zombie debt) revival attempt

Plaintiff is suing on a debt that is past the 6-year SOL but
claims a partial payment or written acknowledgment re-started
the clock.

**Defenses commonly raised in this pattern**:

- **Statute of limitations**, with detailed factual analysis
  of when the SOL ran
- **No revival** — under ORS 12.230, a payment alone does not
  re-start the SOL on most debts; only a **written promise to
  pay** can revive

**Counterclaims**:

- **FDCPA** (1692e(2), 1692e(5), 1692f(1)) — suing on a
  time-barred debt is misleading and unfair
- **Oregon UTPA** — equivalent

### Pattern 4: Default judgment entered improperly

Defendant didn't answer; default judgment entered. Now in
collection.

**Approach**:

- **Motion to vacate under ORCP 71** — see `or-post-judgment`
- **Exemption claims on garnishment** under ORS 18.700+
- **FDCPA / UTPA claims** for continued collection on a
  fraudulent judgment

### Pattern 5: Unauthorized debt collection

Plaintiff is a collection agency that is NOT registered with
the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services
(DCBS) as required by ORS 697.015.

**Defenses**:

- **Lack of capacity to sue** — unregistered collection
  agencies cannot maintain an action (ORS 697.105)
- **Motion to dismiss under ORCP 21**

**Counterclaims**:

- **ORS 697.085** — private right of action for unregistered
  collection
- **Oregon UTPA** — unregistered collection is an unfair
  practice

## Substantive law — quick reference

### FDCPA (15 USC § 1692 et seq.)

The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Applies to
**debt collectors** (not original creditors) collecting
**consumer** debt.

| Section | Subject |
|---------|---------|
| 1692c | Communication restrictions |
| 1692d | Harassment / abuse |
| 1692e | False or misleading representations |
| 1692f | Unfair practices |
| 1692g | Validation notices |
| 1692k | Civil liability ($1,000 statutory + actual + fees) |
| 1692k(d) | 1-year SOL |

See `references/fdcpa.md` for the full annotated FDCPA.

### Regulation F (12 CFR pt 1006)

The CFPB's implementing regulation, effective November 30,
2021. Implements and supplements FDCPA. Key provisions:

| Section | Subject |
|---------|---------|
| § 1006.6 | Communication with consumers |
| § 1006.18 | False or misleading representations |
| § 1006.22 | Unfair or unconscionable practices |
| § 1006.26 | Time-barred debt |
| § 1006.30 | Notice requirements (replaces FDCPA validation) |
| § 1006.34 | Validation information |

See `references/reg-f.md` for the full annotated Reg F.

### Oregon UTPA (ORS 646.605–646.656)

Oregon's consumer-protection statute. Broader than FDCPA in
some respects:

- Applies to ALL persons collecting consumer debt, not just
  "debt collectors"
- No $1,000 cap; actual damages, $200 statutory minimum,
  punitive damages, injunctive relief
- Prevailing-party fees mandatory under ORS 646.638(3)
- 1-year SOL from discovery; 6-year repose under ORS
  646.638(6)

Key sections:

- **ORS 646.607** — unconscionable tactics list
- **ORS 646.608** — unlawful trade practices catalog
- **ORS 646.638** — private right of action

See `references/utpa.md` for the full annotated UTPA.

### Oregon Collection Agency Registration Act (ORS 697)

Regulates **collection agencies** (debt collectors) in
Oregon.

- **ORS 697.005** — definitions; "collection agency" includes
  debt buyers
- **ORS 697.015** — registration required with DCBS
- **ORS 697.058** — prohibited practices
- **ORS 697.085** — private right of action; actual damages,
  $200 statutory minimum, attorney fees
- **ORS 697.105** — registration is condition of capacity to
  sue (unregistered agency cannot bring an action in Oregon
  courts)

See `references/ors-697.md` for the full annotated ORS 697.

### Chain of title

A debt buyer must prove every link in the chain from original
creditor to itself. Typical chain:

```
Original Creditor (Bank of America)
       ↓ Bulk Sale Agreement, Bill of Sale, Assignment
Debt Pool Purchaser 1 (e.g., Asset Acceptance)
       ↓ Bulk Sale Agreement, etc.
Debt Pool Purchaser 2 (e.g., Velocity Investments)
       ↓ Sale to current Plaintiff
Plaintiff (LVNV Funding, LLC)
```

Each link requires:

- **Bill of Sale** — the document evidencing the sale
- **Assignment Schedule** — the inventory listing the specific
  accounts assigned
- **Authentication** — under OEC 901 / 902(11), the bill of
  sale must be authenticated by a witness from the assigning
  entity

Debt buyers often produce only a **summary** bill of sale and
a **redacted** assignment schedule. The defendant's
discovery target: the **un-redacted** versions, plus the
**cardholder agreement** between defendant and original
creditor.

See `references/chain-of-title.md` for the full doctrine.

## Discovery banks (subject-matter-specific)

Pre-built request banks for debt-defense discovery. These
plug into the procedural framework in `or-discovery`:

- **`references/rfp-debt-buyer.md`** — First Requests for
  Production targeting chain of title, original-creditor
  records, plaintiff's records of the account, communications,
  collection history
- **`references/rfa-debt-buyer.md`** — Requests for Admission
  locking in foundational facts (plaintiff's corporate form,
  registration status, dates of acquisition)
- **`references/interrogatories-debt-buyer.md`** —
  Interrogatories in mandatory arbitration (where allowed by
  arbitrator) — **Oregon does NOT have written interrogatories
  in standard ORCP discovery**
- **`references/meet-and-confer-debt-buyer.md`** — Sample
  meet-and-confer letters and follow-up emails

## Evidence patterns

The OEC 803(6) / 902(11) foundation question is the critical
evidentiary battleground in Oregon debt-buyer cases. The
plaintiff's typical declaration:

> "I am the custodian of records for [Plaintiff Debt Buyer].
> Plaintiff maintains records of accounts in the ordinary
> course of business. Account number ending XXXX was assigned
> to Plaintiff on [date] by [Original Creditor]. Plaintiff's
> records show a balance of $[amount] owing on the account.
> True and correct copies of the records are attached."

This declaration typically **fails** as foundation because:

1. The declarant is the **debt buyer's** custodian, not the
   original creditor's
2. The original creditor's records are hearsay — the
   declarant cannot attest that they were made in the regular
   course of the original creditor's business
3. The "remote custodian" doctrine — the debt buyer cannot
   speak to the trustworthiness of records it didn't create

See `references/evidence-debt-buyer.md` for the doctrine and
the specific objection language.
