# Oregon Statewide Court Document Formatting

Use these rules whenever drafting a paper to be filed in an Oregon
circuit court. They derive from the **Uniform Trial Court Rules
(UTCR) Chapter 2** (Form of Documents) and common statewide drafting
conventions used by the Oregon Judicial Department (OJD).

Oregon consolidated its trial courts in 1998 — there is no separate
district court system. All civil matters file in **Circuit Court**
regardless of amount in controversy. Small claims (≤ $10,000) and
court-annexed mandatory arbitration ($10,000–$50,000) are
sub-procedures **within** Circuit Court (ORS Ch. 46 and ORS 36.400
et seq., respectively).

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Generated content is a drafting aid; verify
> against current UTCR, ORCP, and the local Supplemental Local Rules
> (SLR) for the specific circuit before filing.

## UTCR 2.010 format requirements (mandatory)

| Item | Rule |
|------|------|
| Paper size | US Letter, 8½ × 11 inches |
| Sides | Single-sided only |
| Top margin, page 1 | **At least 3 inches** to leave room for the clerk's filing stamp |
| All other margins | **At least 1 inch** (top of subsequent pages, bottom, left, right) |
| Color | Black or blue-black ink only; **no colored or highlighted text** in the body |
| Attachments / exhibits | Same rule applies unless the nature of the attachment makes compliance impractical (color photo as evidence, native screenshots) |
| Citations | Conform to the Oregon Appellate Courts Style Manual (latest edition, OJD) |
| eFiling | Mandatory in every circuit court through **File and Serve** (Tyler) — accept PDFs only |

When producing a `.docx` programmatically for upload to File and
Serve, apply a 1-inch top margin to the whole section and add ~2
inches of leading space before the caption on page 1 so the
effective top margin for page 1 is 3 inches. Subsequent pages then
fall at 1 inch automatically.

**Do not use colored highlighting or colored text** anywhere in the
pleading body. Color is permitted in attachments only when the
nature of the attachment makes B&W impractical (for example, a
native phone screenshot).

## Default typography

- **Font**: Times New Roman 12 pt (Arial 12 pt is also accepted)
- **Line spacing**: 1.5 or double-spaced for body text; single-spaced
  for block quotations, signature blocks, and tables
- **Paragraph numbering**: Bold Arabic numeral followed by a period
  and tab, e.g. `1.\tI am the Defendant...`
- **Bold lead-ins** for labeled paragraphs: `**Background.**` at
  the start of a paragraph, then regular text

## Required footer (mandatory on every generated document)

Every generated document MUST carry a running footer on every page
with:

- **Left**: a short document identifier — typically
  `[Document title] — Case No. [case number]` (e.g., `Motion to
  Compel — Case No. 25CV12345`). Keep it to a single line so it
  never wraps.
- **Right**: `Page X of Y`, where `X` is the current page and `Y` is
  the total page count. Use Word's `PAGE` and `NUMPAGES` fields —
  never a static number.
- **Font**: 10 pt Times New Roman (matches body font family;
  smaller for visual hierarchy).
- **Alignment**: a right-aligned tab stop at 9,360 DXA (6.5″)
  places the page counter flush right while the title stays flush
  left.

The footer runs continuously from page 1 through the last exhibit
page — do not restart or suppress pagination anywhere.
`scripts/format-check.py` validates the footer and will FAIL on a
document missing the `NUMPAGES` field, the `PAGE` field, or a
non-pagination title on the left.

See `references/docx-generation.md` for the exact `docx-js` recipe.

## Caption structure (UTCR 2.100)

Two columns separated by a vertical rule:

```
            IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE STATE OF OREGON
                  FOR THE COUNTY OF MULTNOMAH

VELOCITY INVESTMENTS, LLC,         │  Case No. 25CV12345
                                   │
        Plaintiff,                 │  [DOCUMENT TITLE IN ALL CAPS,
                                   │   BOLD, WRAPPED TO 4–6 LINES]
        v.                         │
                                   │
JOHN DOE,                          │
                                   │
        Defendant.                 │
```

UTCR 2.100 requirements:

- **Court header** (top, centered, bold): "IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF
  THE STATE OF OREGON" on line 1, "FOR THE COUNTY OF [COUNTY]" on
  line 2
- **Party block** (left): parties in ALL CAPS, bold; role
  (Plaintiff, Defendant, Petitioner, Respondent) in normal case,
  indented under the party name
- **Case number** (top right, bold): `25CV12345` (year-CV-sequence,
  no spaces or dashes) for civil cases; small claims `25SC12345`;
  domestic relations `25DR12345`
- **Document title** (right, all caps, bold, wrapped): the full
  UTCR 2.110 title — every required descriptor in capitals
- **Vertical rule**: one line, on the right edge of the left cell OR
  the left edge of the right cell (not both — avoids double rules)
- **Horizontal rule** below the caption separating it from the body

Build the caption as a two-cell borderless table; add the vertical
border as above. Cell widths 4,680 DXA each on a 9,360 DXA (6.5-inch)
content area.

Use **"v."** (lowercase, with period) between parties — Oregon
convention. Not "vs."

## UTCR 2.110 — Document titles

The title at the top of the document (and in the caption) must:

- Be in ALL CAPS, bold
- State the **party making the filing** (e.g., "DEFENDANT'S MOTION
  TO COMPEL")
- State the **nature of the document** with enough specificity that
  the clerk can index it correctly (e.g., "MOTION TO COMPEL
  PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS UNDER ORCP 46")
- Identify whether the matter is **on the merits** or part of a
  subsidiary proceeding (small claims, mandatory arbitration, etc.)
- For motions: state whether oral argument is requested and the
  type of hearing (e.g., "ORAL ARGUMENT REQUESTED — 20 MINUTES")

The title appears in three places: the caption right column, again
at the top of the body on page 1, and in the document filename when
uploaded to File and Serve.

## UTCR 2.120 — Confidential information

Redact before filing. UTCR 2.100(7) and 2.120 require that the
following be omitted from publicly filed documents:

- Social Security numbers (use last four digits only)
- Bank account numbers, credit-card numbers (last four only)
- Dates of birth (year only, except for minor parties in family
  cases)
- Names of minor children (use initials)
- Home addresses of victims, witnesses (where applicable)

Confidential personal information is filed on a **separate
Confidential Information Form (CIF)** under UTCR 2.130 and is
sealed by the clerk.

## Required body elements

Every declaration needs (under ORCP 1 E and ORS 9.320, declarations
"under penalty of perjury" are accepted in place of notarized
affidavits for most filings — see ORCP 1 E and 28 USC § 1746
language):

1. **Salutation clause** at the top of the body:
   "I, [Name], declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
   the State of Oregon that the following is true and correct:"
2. **Numbered paragraphs** with substantive content
3. **Verification clause** at the end (Oregon form):
   "I hereby declare that the above statements are true to the
   best of my knowledge and belief, and I understand they are
   made for use as evidence in court and are subject to penalty
   for perjury."
   (Or the shorter ORCP 1 E form: "I declare under penalty of
   perjury under the laws of the State of Oregon that the
   foregoing is true and correct.")
4. **Date and place of execution**:
   "DATED this ____ day of __________, 20__."
   "Executed at [city], Oregon."
5. **Signature block** with signer name, role, address, phone,
   email

Motions and memoranda do not need a perjury clause but do need a
signature block with name, role, address, phone, and email, plus a
**Certificate of Service** (UTCR 1.090 / ORCP 9 G) if served with
the filing.

## Exhibits

Embed exhibits at the end of the paper, after the signature block,
in this order:

1. **Exhibit List** page, centered title, each entry like:
   `Exhibit 1:    [one-line description]`
2. One **cover page per exhibit**: `EXHIBIT 1` centered and bold at
   the top of the page, followed by an italic caption describing
   the exhibit, then the exhibit image or text
3. Footer pagination continues through the exhibits — do not
   restart the page counter

Oregon convention is **numbered exhibits** ("Exhibit 1, Exhibit 2,
...") not lettered. This differs from Washington (lettered, "Exhibit
A, Exhibit B, ..."). Reference exhibits in the body by number:
"True and correct screenshots are attached as **Exhibits 1
through 4**."

## The four document templates

See the `references/templates/` directory for complete scaffolds:

- `declaration.md` — declaration with numbered paragraphs and
  exhibits
- `motion-with-memo.md` — motion with companion memorandum
- `notice-of-hearing.md` — Oregon-standard notice form
  (analogous to a "Note for Motion Docket")
- `proposed-order.md` — findings and order for judge signature

Each template includes the caption, body skeleton, signature block,
and (for declarations) exhibit list scaffolding.

## Citation format (Oregon Appellate Courts Style Manual)

Follow the Oregon Appellate Courts Style Manual (the "OACSM" or
"Oregon Style Manual") published by the OJD. Common forms:

- Oregon Supreme Court: `Buchler v. Oregon Corrections Div., 316 Or 499, 853 P2d 798 (1993)`
- Oregon Court of Appeals: `State v. Smith, 250 Or App 1, 280 P3d 1 (2012)`
- 9th Circuit: `Mansor v. Or. Inv. Co., 819 F3d 1119 (9th Cir 2016)`
- ORS: `ORS 12.080(1)` (no section symbol for ORS in Oregon style)
- ORCP: `ORCP 47 C` (subsections by upper-case letter, separated by
  spaces, no parentheses)
- OEC: `OEC 803(6)` (subsections in parentheses, by number)
- UTCR: `UTCR 2.010(1)`
- Federal statutes: `15 USC § 1692k(a)(1)` (no periods in "USC" in
  Oregon style; Bluebook would use "U.S.C.")
- Federal regulations: `12 CFR § 1006.30` (Oregon style; no periods
  in "CFR")

**Distinctive Oregon style choices**:
- No periods after `Or`, `Or App`, `P2d`, `P3d`, `F2d`, `F3d`, `US`,
  `USC`, `CFR` (Bluebook puts periods after all)
- Use `v.` (with period) between parties; italicize case names
  including the `v.`
- Spaces, not parentheses, separate ORCP subsection letters: `ORCP
  21 A` not `ORCP 21(A)`
- OEC subsections use parentheses with numerals: `OEC 803(6)`
- No "&" or "et seq." within citations — use page pins

Italicize case names (including `v.`). Use the regional reporter
(P2d / P3d) — Oregon does not have its own state reporter for the
Supreme Court, only the Oregon Reports (Or, Or App), which are
parallel-cited.

## Producing documents programmatically

For `.docx` generation, use the `docx` npm package and follow the
patterns in `references/docx-generation.md`. Key points:

- Set page size explicitly to US Letter (12,240 × 15,840 DXA) —
  `docx-js` defaults to A4
- Use `Times New Roman` at `size: 24` (half-points = 12 pt)
- Add a leading paragraph with `spacing: { before: 2880 }` (2
  inches) on page 1 to yield the 3-inch effective top margin
- Use `LevelFormat.BULLET` with a numbering config for bullets —
  never unicode bullet characters
- Build the footer with a right-aligned tab stop at 9,360 DXA and
  use `PageNumber.CURRENT` / `PageNumber.TOTAL_PAGES` for "Page X
  of Y"

For format validation, use the bundled `scripts/format-check.py`
on a generated `.docx`.

## eFiling — OJD File and Serve

Every Oregon circuit court accepts (and requires) electronic filing
through **File and Serve** (Tyler Tech), the OJD's statewide
eFiling portal:

- Self-represented filer portal: https://www.courts.oregon.gov/services/online/Pages/efile.aspx
- File and Serve: https://oregon.tylertech.cloud/
- File size limit: typically 25 MB per document; larger filings are
  split into separately uploaded PDFs
- Accepted format: PDF only (no .docx for the filed document
  itself; the .docx is the working copy)
- Document codes are picked from a dropdown matching the UTCR 2.110
  title — pick the closest match

Service through File and Serve counts as service for parties who
have registered for eService (ORCP 9 G(1)(d), UTCR 21.100). For
parties who have not registered, follow ORCP 9 D (mail, hand
delivery, or any of the other approved methods).

## Compose with court-specific skills

This skill is **always** layered with:

- `or-multcc` — if the case is in Multnomah County Circuit Court
- `or-wccc` — if the case is in Washington County Circuit Court
- `or-county-courts` — for any other county
- `or-pro-se` — if the litigant is self-represented

The court-specific skill adds the local SLR variations, motion
scheduling, working-copy practice, and the venue-specific filing
quirks.
