# Assemble an Oregon Court Filing Packet

Gather and organize all documents required for a complete
Oregon civil filing: motion, supporting declaration, exhibits,
proposed order, Notice of Hearing, and Certificate of Service.

## Standard packet for a noted civil motion

| # | Document | Skill |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | Motion + Memorandum | `or-draft-motion` |
| 2 | Supporting Declaration(s) with exhibits | `or-draft-declaration` |
| 3 | Proposed Order ("[PROPOSED]" in title) | `or-draft-order` |
| 4 | Notice of Hearing | `or-draft-note` |
| 5 | Certificate of Service | UTCR 1.090 |

Optionally:
- **Working copies** (Multnomah SLR 5.100, Washington Co SLR
  5.100 — over threshold pages) — paper packet delivered to
  chambers
- **Application for Fee Waiver** (ORS 21.682) if filing fees
  cannot be paid

## Step-by-step

### Step 1: Reserve the hearing date

Per the court's procedure (see `or-schedule-hearing`).

### Step 2: Draft each document

For each document, use the relevant draft-* skill:

- Motion + Memorandum → `or-draft-motion`
- Declaration → `or-draft-declaration`
- Proposed Order → `or-draft-order`
- Notice of Hearing → `or-draft-note`

### Step 3: Run Quality Check

Run `or-quality-check` against each document:

- UTCR 2.010 format compliance
- pro-se drafting framework content checks
- Citation format

Fix any FAILs before proceeding.

### Step 4: Run Fact Check

Run `or-fact-check` against the entire packet:

- Citation verification
- Internal consistency (within each document)
- Packet consistency (across documents)
- Sworn-vs.-argued consistency

Fix any FAILs before proceeding.

### Step 5: Preflight checklist

Before filing, verify:

#### Captions

- [ ] All five documents use **identical** court header
- [ ] All five documents have the **same case number**
- [ ] All five documents have the **same party names in the
      same order**
- [ ] Document titles match what's actually in the body

#### Hearing details (across motion, Notice of Hearing,
proposed order)

- [ ] **Date** matches
- [ ] **Time** matches
- [ ] **Mode** (in-person / WebEx) matches
- [ ] **Courtroom or connection info** matches
- [ ] **Assigned judge** matches

#### Service

- [ ] Certificate of Service in each document (or as a
      separate document)
- [ ] All parties identified by full name and address (or
      email)
- [ ] Method of service identified

#### Exhibits

- [ ] All exhibits referenced in the motion or declaration
      are present
- [ ] Exhibit numbering is sequential and consistent
- [ ] Cover pages and Exhibit List present in the
      declaration

#### File and Serve readiness

- [ ] Each document is in PDF format
- [ ] Each document is under 25 MB (or split if larger)
- [ ] Document codes selected matching UTCR 2.110 titles
- [ ] Filing fees identified (or fee-waiver application
      attached)

#### Signature

- [ ] Signature block on each document
- [ ] Date is filled in (or fill-in blanks for handwritten
      date)
- [ ] OSB# if counsel; omitted if pro se

#### Confidential information (UTCR 2.120)

- [ ] SSN redacted (last 4 only)
- [ ] Account numbers redacted (last 4 only)
- [ ] Minor children referenced by initials
- [ ] DOB redacted (year only for adults)

### Step 6: File via File and Serve

#### Sequence

In Multnomah, file each document separately with its own
document code. The order:

1. Motion + Memorandum — "Motion (Other)" or specific code
2. Supporting Declaration — "Declaration of [Name]"
3. Proposed Order — "Order — Proposed"
4. Notice of Hearing — "Notice of Hearing"
5. Certificate of Service — "Certificate of Service" (or
   included as page of each filed document)

#### Document codes

Pick from the File and Serve dropdown matching the UTCR 2.110
title. If no exact match, use the closest available; some
codes are:

- Motion (Other)
- Motion to Compel
- Motion to Dismiss
- Motion for Summary Judgment
- Motion to Vacate
- Memorandum in Support of Motion
- Declaration of [Name]
- Order — Proposed
- Notice of Hearing
- Certificate of Service

#### Fees

Pay or apply for waiver at submission. Filing fees:

| Filing | Fee (approximate) |
|--------|-------------------|
| Motion (most types) | ~$11 |
| Order — Proposed | $0 (no fee for proposed order) |
| Notice of Hearing | $0 |
| Declaration | $0 |

Verify against https://www.courts.oregon.gov/services/fees/.

### Step 7: Working copies (if required)

For Multnomah (over 25 pages total) or Washington Co (over 15
pages total):

- Print one complete packet (motion + memo + decl + exhibits +
  proposed order)
- Tab each document on its own tab
- Bind (binder clip, staple, or perfect bind)
- Add a cover with case caption, hearing date, judge name,
  and a short index of what's enclosed

Deliver:

- **Multnomah**: Mail room (loading dock) at 1200 SW 1st Ave,
  Portland; addressed to "Hon. [Judge Name], c/o [JA Name]"
- **Washington Co**: Civil Division counter, 2nd floor, 145
  NE 2nd Ave, Hillsboro
- Verify per-judge variations from the standing order

### Step 8: Serve under ORCP 9 / UTCR 21.100

- **eService through File and Serve**: for registered parties,
  service is automatic upon filing
- **Email**: for parties consenting in writing
- **Mail**: USPS first-class for non-registered parties
- **Hand delivery**: optional

Certificate of Service (UTCR 1.090) documents the service.

### Step 9: Calendar deadlines and hearing date

- Hearing date — calendar with reminders at 7, 3, and 1 day
  out (see `or-hearings/references/hearing-day-checklist.md`)
- Response deadline (if waiting for opposing party's
  response)
- Reply deadline (if you'll reply to opposing's response)

## Common packet errors

| Error | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| Caption discrepancy between motion and proposed order | Court rejects; refile |
| Hearing date mismatch between Notice and motion | Hearing falls off calendar |
| Missing Certificate of Service | UTCR 1.090 violation; clerk rejects |
| Exhibit numbering mismatch | Confused record; sanctions risk |
| Notice of Hearing filed before JA confirms date | Hearing date may be rejected |
| Filing fee not paid (and no fee-waiver applied) | Filing not accepted |
| Document over 25 MB | Upload fails |
| Wrong document code in File and Serve | Filing mis-indexed; may delay |
| Working copies not delivered when required | Judge sees incomplete record |
| Caption uses "vs." instead of "v." | Cosmetic but unprofessional |

## After filing

- **Confirm acceptance** within 1–2 business days (File and
  Serve sends email)
- **If rejected**, fix and re-file before any deadline
- **Update the calendar** with the hearing date and any
  intermediate deadlines
- **Track opposing's response** — if no response by the
  deadline, the motion is unopposed (judges may rule on the
  papers)
- **Prepare for the hearing** (see `or-hearings`)

## Pro se packet considerations

A pro se filer's packet is judged by the same standard as
counsel's. Common pro se shortcuts to avoid:

- Combining motion + declaration into one document (file
  separately)
- Skipping the Notice of Hearing (most courts require it)
- Lettered exhibits (use numbers in Oregon)
- Static page numbers in the footer (use PAGE / NUMPAGES
  Word fields)
- Forgetting the proposed order (judges expect one)
- No working copies for Multnomah over-25-page motions

## Companion skills

Run before assembling packet:
- `or-statewide-format` — formatting baseline
- `or-pro-se` — pro-se drafting framework
- The relevant draft-* skills

Run during packet assembly:
- `or-quality-check` — format pass
- `or-fact-check` — substantive pass

Run after filing:
- `or-hearings` — prep for the hearing

## Cross-references

- All draft-* skills — the individual documents
- `or-quality-check` — format pass
- `or-fact-check` — substantive pass
- `or-schedule-hearing` — reserving the date (prerequisite)
- `or-hearings` — preparing for the hearing (next step)
- `or-statewide-format/references/templates/` — the four
  primary templates
