overlay the statewide CR + GR. Key PCLR provisions:

### PCLR 4 — Initial filings

- Confidential information form for cases with sealed
  attachments under GR 22

### PCLR 7 — Motion practice

PCLR 7 sets the motion-day timing (motion / response /
reply schedule). Specific day counts are amended by
order of court — **read PCLR 7 from
`wa-law-references/references/court-rules/`** (or hand
off to `wa-deadlines`) for the current schedule. Working
copies to judge or commissioner.

### PCLR 16 — Case schedule

Standing case-management order issued by court setting:

- Joint Status Conference deadline
- Discovery cutoff
- Pretrial conference
- Trial date

## E-filing — LINX

system. Access: https://linxonline.co.pierce.wa.us/

## Mandatory Arbitration of Civil Actions — RCW 7.06 + MAR

Pierce County **participates** in mandatory arbitration.
Civil cases below the local jurisdictional cap are
referred to arbitration after answer + initial
discovery. **The cap and the trial-de-novo window are
set by RCW 7.06 and the WA MAR; read current values from
`wa-law-references/references/wa-rcw-debt/RCW-7_06.md`
and from `court-rules/MAR.md`** rather than relying on
memory — RCW 7.06.020 lets counties set local caps and
the procedural rules can be amended. Sanctions apply if
the trial de novo result is no better than the
arbitration award (per MAR 7.3).

## Commissioners

Pierce County uses commissioners (under RCW 2.24) for:

- Ex parte
- Family law motions
- Probate
- Civil protection orders under RCW 7.105
- Some general-civil motions

**Revision motion** — any party may move to revise a
commissioner's ruling under RCW 2.24.050. **The
revision-motion window is statutory; read the current
day count from `RCW-2_24.md`** or hand off to
`wa-deadlines`.

## Remote appearances

Appearances** post-COVID. Cisco WebEx is the dominant
platform; some judges still use Zoom. Check the
specific department's standing order.
