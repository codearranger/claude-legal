  Use this skill when the user asks to draft a motion for a Washington
  State court — superior court or district court (KCDC). Triggers
  include "draft a motion", "write a motion to compel", "I need to
  file a motion to dismiss", "motion for summary judgment", "motion to
  vacate", "motion for reconsideration", "motion for default", "motion

  memorandum that complies with GR 14, statewide motion practice, and
  the Parker framework for concise, fact-forward drafting. Composes
  with `wa-statewide-format` (always), `wa-kcdc` (if KCDC),
  `wa-pro-se` (if pro se), and `wa-discovery` / `wa-post-judgment`
  depending on the motion type.

# Draft a Washington Motion + Supporting Memorandum

Scaffold a motion and companion memorandum that complies with GR 14,
statewide motion practice, and the Parker framework for concise,
fact-forward drafting.

## Inputs to gather

Before drafting, confirm with the user (use AskUserQuestion for any
that are unclear):

1. **Motion type** — What is being asked of the court? (e.g., compel,
   dismiss, strike, default, summary judgment, vacate, reconsider)
2. **Court** — Which court? Load `wa-kcdc` if KCDC.
3. **Case caption** — Party names and case number
4. **Movant** — Who is filing? Pro se? Represented?
5. **Rule basis** — Which CR or CRLJ rule authorizes the motion?
6. **Key facts** — What are the 1–3 single best facts supporting relief?
7. **Relief sought** — Specific, enforceable relief
8. **Single or separate** — Combined motion+argument (simpler) or
   separate motion + memorandum (complex)?
9. **Supporting declaration** — Is there a declaration already filed,
   or does one need to be drafted alongside?

## Steps

1. **Load the companion skills.** Read:
   - `skills/wa-statewide-format/SKILL.md`
   - `skills/wa-statewide-format/references/templates/motion-with-memo.md`
   - `skills/wa-pro-se/SKILL.md` and
     `skills/wa-pro-se/references/parker-framework.md` if pro se
   - `skills/wa-kcdc/SKILL.md` and
     `skills/wa-kcdc/references/civil-motion-docket.md` if KCDC

2. **Choose option A or B:**
   - **Option A (self-contained)**: for simple motions — single
     document with Relief / Facts / Argument / Conclusion
   - **Option B (motion + memo)**: for complex motions — short motion
     with grounds, plus a separate 3–5 page memorandum

3. **Apply the Parker framework:**
   - Lead with the single best fact
   - Argument headings state the conclusion, not the topic
     (e.g., "A. The chain of title is missing" not "A. Chain of title")
   - Every factual assertion cited to exhibit or declaration paragraph
   - Every legal assertion cited to rule, statute, or case
   - Keep the motion ≤ 2 pages and memo ≤ 5 pages (combined ≤ 6)

4. **Draft in markdown first** using the scaffolded structure from
   `motion-with-memo.md`. Include:
   - Court caption with "NOTE ON MOTION CALENDAR" block
   - Roman-numeral section headings (I. RELIEF REQUESTED, II. FACTS,
     etc.)
   - Bold lead-in argument headings
   - Signature block

5. **Review with the user.** Show the draft. Iterate on the
   arguments, facts, and relief before generating the .docx.

6. **Generate the .docx** using the docx-js patterns in
   `skills/wa-statewide-format/references/docx-generation.md`.

7. **Offer companion documents.** Remind the user they likely also
   need a Declaration in support, a Proposed Order, a Note for Motion
   Docket, and a Certificate of Service. If any are missing, the
   agent can scaffold them using the `wa-draft-declaration`,
   `wa-draft-order`, and `wa-draft-note` skills — and assemble the
   full filing via the `wa-file-packet` skill when everything is
   ready.

8. **Deliver** via `computer://` link. Offer to run a GR 14 / content
   check using the `wa-quality-check` skill.

## Notes

- Under-ask rather than over-ask. A tight motion that asks for one
  precise thing is more persuasive than a kitchen-sink motion
- If combined, label the document "[MOTION TITLE] AND MEMORANDUM IN
  SUPPORT"
- Reserve CRLJ 11 sanctions for a separate motion — never combine
- For KCDC: remember the three-step motion-docket protocol — a
  hearing date is **not** self-selected. The `wa-schedule-hearing`
  skill handles step 1 (the CivilMGT email). Don't draft the Note
  until the clerks issue a date.
