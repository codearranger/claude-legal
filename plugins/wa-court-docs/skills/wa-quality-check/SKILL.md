description: >
  Use this skill when the user asks to QC, review, format-check, or
  otherwise validate a Washington court document before filing.
  Triggers include "check this document", "QC this", "is this GR 14
  compliant", "format check", "review my motion before I file", "run
  a compliance check", "check my declaration". Runs a two-pass check:
  (1) a GR 14 **format** pass via `scripts/format-check.py` (paper
  size, margins, fonts, color, pagination) and (2) a **content** pass
  applying the pro-se drafting framework checklist, citation form, caption
  accuracy, and common pro se red flags. Also auto-detects motion
  type and runs motion-specific checks (CR 12(b)(6), CR 37, CR 56,
  CR 60). Composes with `wa-statewide-format`, `wa-kcdc`, and
  `wa-pro-se`.

# Quality Check — Format + Content

Run a two-pass quality check on a Washington court document before
filing.

## Arguments

If the user names a file path, use it. Otherwise, Glob the workspace
for recent `.docx` files and ask which one to check.

## Pass 1 — Format check (GR 14)

1. **Run the checker:**

   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/format-check.py" "<path>"
   ```

2. **Parse output** and summarize:
   - ✅ PASS: item complies
   - ⚠️ WARN: item may deviate; user should verify manually
   - ❌ FAIL: item does not comply; must be fixed

3. **What is checked:**
   - Paper size (Letter: 8.5" × 11")
   - Margins (1" on all sides at minimum; 3" top on page 1 is a
     recommendation, not a strict GR 14 requirement)
   - Line spacing (≥ 1.5 for body)
   - Font family (Times New Roman or similar proportional serif)
   - Font size (≥ 12pt in body)
   - No color text, no highlighting (GR 14(a) "no color markings")
   - Footer contains page numbers
   - Numbered paragraphs (if declaration)

4. **For each failure**, explain:
   - What GR 14 requires
   - Where the deviation is
   - How to fix it (either in Word or by regenerating with the
     docx-js template)

## Pass 2 — Content check

## Notes

- **Do not auto-edit** without asking — show the report first, then
  offer specific edits
- Use `wa-statewide-format`, `wa-kcdc`, and `wa-pro-se` skill
  knowledge when interpreting the output
- This is a last-check pass — use after a full draft, not during
  scaffolding
- Color in exhibit screenshots is permitted under GR 14(a) when
  grayscale would make them illegible — the format checker flags
  these as warnings, not failures
- Always read the actual rule if in doubt:
  `skills/wa-statewide-format/references/gr-14-full-text.md`
