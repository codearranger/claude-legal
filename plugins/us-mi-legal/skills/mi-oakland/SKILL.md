Use this skill in addition to `mi-statewide-format` when the case
is in the **Oakland County Circuit Court**, Michigan's **Sixth
Judicial Circuit**. Oakland is one of Michigan's most populous
counties; its Circuit Court is a high-volume general civil and
criminal trial court.

## Location and divisions

- **Oakland County Courthouse**, Pontiac (the Circuit Court
  complex on the County Service Center campus). Confirm the
  current street address, department/courtroom, and any annex
  locations with the Clerk / Register of Deeds office before
  filing or appearing.
- The Circuit Court is organized into a **Civil/Criminal
  Division** (general civil litigation and felony criminal) and a
  separate **Family Division** (domestic relations, juvenile,
  guardianship — see `mi-family-court`).
- This skill addresses the **Civil/Criminal Division** civil
  side. The Family Division is governed by MCR subchapter 3.200
  and is out of scope here.

## Jurisdiction

- The Circuit Court is Michigan's court of **general
  jurisdiction**. Civil actions seeking **more than $25,000** are
  filed in Circuit Court; matters at or below $25,000 are District
  Court matters (see `mi-district-courts`, `mi-36th-district`).
- Equity, superintending-control, and most appeals from District
  Court and administrative agencies also lie in Circuit Court.
- Confirm the amount-in-controversy and any small-claims /
  district overlap before choosing the forum.

## Case-type and case-number conventions

- Michigan circuit-court case numbers follow the statewide SCAO
  pattern of a **two-digit year, a sequential number, and a
  case-type code** (for example, a general civil case carries the
  **"NZ" / "CZ"**-family code, a business/commercial case the
  **"CB"** code, and an auto-negligence case the **"NI"** code).
  Confirm the exact suffix the Oakland clerk assigns for your
  cause of action — the case-type code drives docket routing.
- The case number, once assigned, anchors the caption per
  `mi-statewide-format`. **Do not guess the case-type code**;
  confirm it against the current SCAO case-type code list and the
  Oakland clerk's intake practice.

## Michigan Business Court (MCL 600.8031 et seq.)

- Every circuit with **not fewer than 3 circuit judges** must
  operate a **Business Court** as a special docket (MCL 600.8033).
  The Sixth Circuit (Oakland) meets that threshold and maintains a
  Business Court docket.
- A **"business or commercial dispute"** under **MCL 600.8031**
  includes actions where all parties are business enterprises, or
  where at least one party is a business enterprise and the claim
  arises out of the parties' business or commercial relationship —
  e.g., disputes over the sale/merger of a business, shareholder
  and member rights, commercial contracts, commercial real
  property, and trade-secret / non-compete matters.
- The statute **expressly excludes** personal injury, product
  liability, family-law matters, employment discrimination and
  civil-rights actions, wrongful discharge (except claims by
  corporate officers/directors), and workers'-compensation
  claims — those do **not** belong on the Business Court docket.
- A complaint that pleads a qualifying business/commercial dispute
  should be flagged for the Business Court docket at filing
  (typically via the case-type code and a civil cover sheet).
  Confirm the current Business Court assignment mechanics and any
  required statement with the Oakland clerk. See
  `mi-commercial-disputes` for the substantive framework.

## Local administrative orders and scheduling practice

- Beyond the statewide MCR, the Sixth Circuit operates under its
  own **local administrative orders (LAOs)** approved by the State
  Court Administrative Office, which govern case assignment,
  e-filing specifics, and docket management.
- The Circuit Court manages civil cases through **case-management
  and scheduling orders**: after the case is at issue, the court
  enters a **scheduling order** setting discovery cutoffs,
  motion-cutoff and dispositive-motion dates, case-evaluation /
  ADR (MCR 2.403 / 2.410) dates, settlement-conference dates, and
  the trial date. Calendar your obligations from the **scheduling
  order in your specific case**, not from a generic template.
- Status conferences and a **settlement / pretrial conference**
  are typically required before trial. Confirm the assigned
  judge's individual practice guidelines, motion-call day, and
  praecipe / notice-of-hearing requirements before noticing a
  motion. See `mi-schedule-hearing` and `mi-hearings`.

**Agent behavior:** before drafting a notice of hearing, setting
a page-limited brief, or calendaring a deadline, fetch the current
Sixth Circuit local administrative orders and the assigned judge's
practice guidelines, and read the scheduling order entered in the
case. Confirm motion-call procedure and chambers-copy
requirements.

## E-filing — MiFILE / MiCOURT TrueFiling

- Oakland County Circuit Court participates in Michigan's
  statewide **MiFILE** electronic-filing system (the **MiCOURT
  TrueFiling** platform). Confirm whether e-filing is **mandatory**
  for your case type and party, the current document-type
  selections, and the filing-fee / fee-waiver workflow.
- See `mi-file-packet` for the packet-assembly and preflight
  workflow and `mi-statewide-format` for the MCR 1.109 electronic
  document requirements.
