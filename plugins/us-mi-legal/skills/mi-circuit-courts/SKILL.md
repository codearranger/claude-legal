# Michigan Circuit Courts — Roll-Up

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Drafting and filing guidance only. Verify
> the controlling circuit, its local administrative orders, and
> its e-filing (MiFILE) status with the clerk and the current
> court rules before filing.

Use this skill in addition to `mi-statewide-format` when the case
is in a Michigan **circuit court** other than the two flagship
counties, which have their own overlay skills:

| County | Principal city | Circuit | Skill |
|--------|----------------|---------|-------|
| Wayne | Detroit | **3rd** | `mi-wayne` |
| Oakland | Pontiac | **6th** | `mi-oakland` |

## What a circuit court is

The **circuit court** is Michigan's court of **general jurisdiction**
— one in each of the state's judicial circuits, established under MCL
600.501 et seq. It hears:

- **civil cases over $25,000** (claims at or below $25,000 go to the
  district court — see `mi-district-courts`);
- the **Family Division** (domestic relations, custody, support,
  juvenile, personal-protection orders — see `mi-family-court`);
- **felony** criminal matters; and
- **appeals** from district court, probate court, and many
  administrative agencies.

Each circuit has a presiding/chief judge and operates under both the
statewide Michigan Court Rules (MCR) and its own **local
administrative orders (LAOs)** approved by the State Court
Administrative Office (SCAO).

## Confirm the circuit — do not assume

Most Michigan circuits are a **single county**, but several are
**multi-county** (one circuit spanning two or more rural counties).
**Do not state a circuit number you have not verified.** Look up the
controlling circuit and its local administrative orders via the SCAO
court directory at **courts.michigan.gov**.

**Agent behavior:** before drafting anything circuit-specific (a
notice, a scheduling request, a page-limited brief, a proposed
order), confirm (1) which circuit the county sits in, (2) that
circuit's current local administrative orders, and (3) its e-filing
status. Local administrative orders govern motion-call days,
scheduling practice, chambers/judge copies, and case-flow management
on top of the statewide MCR.

## Most-populous circuits — directory

Name the county, its principal city, and the circuit generically;
**confirm the local administrative orders and MiFILE status** before
relying on any specific.

| County | Principal city | Circuit |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Macomb | Mount Clemens | **16th** |
| Kent | Grand Rapids | **17th** |
| Genesee | Flint | **7th** |
| Washtenaw | Ann Arbor | **22nd** |
| Ingham | Lansing | **30th** |
| Kalamazoo | Kalamazoo | **9th** |
| Ottawa | Grand Haven | **20th** |
| Saginaw | Saginaw | **10th** |

This list is illustrative, not exhaustive. For any county not listed,
and to confirm the circuit number and judges for any county listed,
use the SCAO court directory at courts.michigan.gov.

## Michigan Business Court

Each circuit that meets the statutory case-volume threshold maintains
a **Business Court** docket under **MCL 600.8031 et seq.** — a
specialized docket for business and commercial disputes (shareholder
and LLC-member disputes, commercial contract claims above the
statutory amount, trade-secret and non-compete matters, business
torts). Assignment is by case-type code at filing. Whether a given
circuit has a Business Court, and the local assignment mechanics, vary
by circuit — **confirm with the controlling circuit's local
administrative orders.** See `mi-commercial-disputes` for the
substantive framework.

## Caption — generic circuit variant

```
        STATE OF MICHIGAN
        IN THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR THE COUNTY OF [COUNTY]

[PLAINTIFF],
       Plaintiff,
v.                                     Case No. ____________-___
                                       Hon. ____________________
[DEFENDANT],
       Defendant.
___________________________________/

                  [DOCUMENT TITLE]
```

The Michigan case number carries a **case-type code** (e.g., `-CZ`
general civil, `-NZ` other civil, `-CB`/`-CK` Business Court, `-NM`
auto negligence). Use the code that matches the claim; confirm the
circuit's accepted codes. See `mi-statewide-format` for the full MCR
1.109 / MCR 2.113 caption and signature-block conventions, including
the attorney **P-number**.

## Filing — MiFILE status varies by circuit

Michigan is mid-rollout of **MiFILE** (the MiCOURT / TrueFiling
e-filing system). E-filing is **mandatory in some circuits and case
types and not yet live in others**. Confirm the controlling circuit's
MiFILE status and whether e-filing is mandatory before assembling a
packet. See `mi-file-packet`.

## Composition
