# Michigan Hearings

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Hearing-preparation aid only. Verify against
> the assigned judge's practice guidelines, the court's local
> administrative order, and the court's current remote-appearance
> instructions before any hearing.

Use this skill alongside `mi-statewide-format` and the specific venue
skill (`mi-wayne`, `mi-oakland`, `mi-36th-district`,
`mi-circuit-courts`, `mi-district-courts`) when preparing for,
attending, or following up on a hearing.

## Motion practice and oral argument — MCR 2.119

Civil motion practice is governed statewide by **MCR 2.119**. Key
mechanics (see `mi-law-references` for current text, day counts, and
page rules):

- **Form and content** — MCR 2.119(A): a motion must state the relief
  sought and the grounds, and (with limited exceptions) be accompanied
  by a brief. The motion and any response must comply with the MCR
  1.109 document standards (see `mi-statewide-format`).
- **Notice of hearing** — MCR 2.119(C) sets the service-before-hearing
  windows (the standard pre-hearing notice period, with the longer
  period when served by mail). Confirm the current day counts and
  compute the date with `mi-deadlines`.
- **Oral argument** — MCR 2.119(E)(1)-(2): a party may request oral
  argument; many courts hear civil motions on a recurring **motion
  day** or motion-call docket.
- **Court may dispense with oral argument** — **MCR 2.119(E)(3)**
  expressly permits the court to **dispense with or limit oral
  argument** and decide the motion on the briefs. Do not assume you
  will be heard live — check the venue's local administrative order
  and the judge's practice guidelines.

> **Praecipe / notice-of-hearing practice varies by court.** Some
> Michigan courts require a **praecipe** or a separately scheduled
> motion-day slot, others let you notice the hearing directly.
> Confirm the local procedure before noticing. See
> `mi-schedule-hearing`.

## Motion day / motion-call dynamics

- Many Circuit and District courts hear civil motions on a recurring
  **motion-call docket**. Confirm whether the venue requires the
  motion to be **praeciped / set** for a specific motion day, whether
  the judge wants a **judge's copy** delivered in advance, and whether
  oral argument is expected or the matter is submitted on the briefs.
  These are **local-administrative-order and practice-guideline**
  questions — check the court's website and the assigned judge's
  guidelines.
- Be present and ready when your case is called; know whether you are
  arguing, stipulating, or seeking an adjournment.

## Remote proceedings — MCR 2.407

Michigan adopted broad **video and remote-participation** practice
following the 2020 emergency administrative orders, now codified in
**MCR 2.407** (video proceedings). Under MCR 2.407 the court has broad
discretion to allow or require participation by **two-way
interactive video** (commonly Zoom via the court's MiCourt / virtual
courtroom infrastructure), subject to the rule's standards and the
parties' due-process rights.

> Agent behavior: do **not** assume a platform or a meeting ID.
> Whether a given hearing is in-person, remote, or hybrid is set by
> the court's local practice and the assigned judge under MCR 2.407.
> Pull the current remote-appearance instructions and the judge's
> Zoom/virtual-courtroom link from the court's website or the most
> recent notice. Meeting IDs change — never cache or guess them.

If the hearing is remote, the general etiquette holds:

- Join **early** (10-15 minutes); use the court's published link.
- Use your **full legal name** as the display name.
- **Mute** on entry; unmute only when addressed.
- **Camera on** unless the court orders otherwise.
- **Quiet, professional background**; test audio and video first.

## Scheduling and pretrial conferences — MCR 2.401

**MCR 2.401** governs pretrial and **scheduling conferences**. The
court typically enters a **scheduling order** fixing discovery
cutoffs, case-evaluation/ADR dates, motion-completion dates, and
trial. Come prepared to discuss the issues in MCR 2.401(C) (discovery
plan, ADR, witness/exhibit timing). Confirm whether the conference is
in person, by phone, or remote under MCR 2.407.

## ADR — case evaluation and mediation (MCR 2.403 / 2.410 / 2.411)

Most Michigan civil cases pass through an **ADR** step set in the MCR
2.401 scheduling order:

- **MCR 2.410** — general ADR rule; the court selects the ADR process.
- **MCR 2.403** — **case evaluation** (a panel evaluates the case and
  renders an award the parties may accept or reject). Note that the
  former mandatory case-evaluation-sanctions regime was amended;
  confirm the **current** sanction rules in MCR 2.403 via
  `mi-law-references` before relying on them.
- **MCR 2.411** — **mediation** (facilitative mediation before a
  neutral). Settlement and pretrial settlement conferences are common;
  arrive with settlement authority and an updated damages/exposure
  analysis.

## In-person hearings — etiquette

- Arrive **early** (30 minutes) to clear security.
- **Dress** in business attire; pro se filers should wear
  business-casual at minimum (no shorts, hats, or athletic wear).
- **Phones** silenced and put away.
- **Stand** when addressing the court ("May it please the Court, Your
  Honor").
- Address the judge as **"Your Honor"**; refer to opposing counsel and
  parties by **"Mr./Ms. [surname]"** from the podium.

## Hearing-day packet — what to bring

| Item | Purpose |
|---|---|
| 2 paper copies of each filing (court + opposing party) | Even in e-filed (MiFILE) cases, have hard copies at the podium |
| Judge's copy (if practice guidelines require one) | Delivered in advance for longer motions |
| The relevant MCR / MRE excerpts (printed, tabbed) | Have the governing rule text at hand (see `mi-law-references`) |
| Key cases (printed; flagged published vs. unpublished) | Flag the dispositive authorities |
| Witness outlines (if evidentiary) | One per witness; sequential exam outline |
| Exhibit list + copies | Original + court copy + opposing-party copy of each exhibit |
| Proposed order (1 copy + 1 spare) | The court may sign in chambers; see `mi-submit-order` |
| Notepad + 2 pens | Notes during the hearing |

## Oral argument — structure

A workable structure for a Michigan civil motion:

1. **Opening** (~30 sec). "May it please the Court, [Name] for the
   [Plaintiff / Defendant]. This is [Movant]'s Motion to [Dismiss /
   Compel / for Summary Disposition]. We respectfully ask the Court to
   [grant / deny] for [N] reasons."
2. **Roadmap** (~30 sec). "First... Second... Third..."
3. **Substantive argument** — lead with the strongest point; cite the
   governing MCR, MRE, or case; tie back to the record.
4. **Address counter-arguments candidly** — answer the court's
   questions directly; do not duck weaknesses.
5. **Reserve rebuttal** if you are the movant.
6. **Closing** (~15 sec). "For these reasons, [Movant] respectfully
   asks the Court to [grant / deny]. Thank you, Your Honor."

## Evidentiary hearings — special considerations

For evidentiary hearings (injunctions, contempt, post-judgment
creditor exams, disputed-fact motions):

- **Subpoena witnesses** in advance under MCR 2.506.
- **Pre-mark exhibits** per the court's numbering convention.
- **Witness sequestration** — request under MRE 615 if helpful.
- **Stipulations** — confer beforehand to stipulate to undisputed
  facts and to authentication of routine business records under
  MRE 803(6) / 902 (see `mi-law-references`).
- **Record** — confirm with the clerk whether the proceeding is
  recorded by the court (and how the remote record is made if under
  MCR 2.407).

## Adjournments

- **Confer with the opposing party first** — stipulated or unopposed
  motions to adjourn are far more likely to be granted.
- File the motion / stipulation to adjourn **before** the setting,
  stating the current date, the reason, whether opposing counsel
  agrees, and proposed new dates. Many courts want a proposed order.
