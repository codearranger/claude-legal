description: >
  Use when defending an Ohio consumer-debt case (debt-buyer
  collection suit, original-creditor account-stated claim,
  medical-debt action, credit-card balance-transfer dispute,
  CSPA counterclaim). Covers the **Ohio Consumer Sales
  Practices Act** at R.C. Chapter 1345 with **treble damages
  under R.C. 1345.09(B)**, **mandatory attorney's fees under
  R.C. 1345.09(F)**, the **2-year SOL on CSPA claims at R.C.
  1345.10(C)**, federal FDCPA + Reg F overlays, chain-of-
  title doctrine for debt buyers, Ohio's UCC Article 9
  enactment at R.C. Chapter 1309 for assignment authority,
  and the **Ohio 6-year SOL on written contracts at R.C.
  2305.06** (reduced from 15 years by 2012's S.B. 224 and
  further reduced from 8 to 6 by 2021's S.B. 13). Note: Ohio
  has **NO collection-agency licensure regime** — unlike
  Washington's RCW 19.16 or Colorado's CFDCPA registration,
  Ohio debt buyers do not register with any state agency, so
  capacity-to-sue defenses lean on chain-of-title and FDCPA
  rather than licensure status. Triggers include "Ohio
  consumer debt", "Ohio CSPA", "Ohio collection lawsuit",
  "Ohio debt buyer defense", "R.C. 1345 treble damages",
  "Ohio chain of title", "Ohio statute of limitations debt",

# Ohio Consumer Debt — Statutory + Common-Law Defenses

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Verify every cite against current
> R.C. text and current case law before filing. The Ohio
> CSPA has been amended materially in 2012, 2021, and 2023.

## Five fact-pattern triage

When a consumer-debt complaint arrives, triage to one of
these patterns. Each maps to a defense playbook.

### 1. Debt-buyer (post-charge-off) action

Plaintiff is **Midland Funding LLC**, **LVNV Funding LLC**,
**Portfolio Recovery Associates**, **Cavalry SPV I**,
**Crown Asset Management**, **Unifund CCR LLC**, or similar.
Plaintiff is **not** the original creditor (which would be
Citibank, Capital One, Synchrony, Discover, Chase, etc.).

**Core defenses:**
- **Chain of title** — plaintiff must prove every assignment
  from original creditor through any intermediate
  purchasers. Ohio's UCC at R.C. 1309.406 governs the
  rights of an assignee.
- **Account-stated foundation** — plaintiff usually pleads
  "account stated" because it lacks the underlying signed
  contract. Force them to produce the original card-member
  agreement under R.C. 1303.31 (UCC Article 3 negotiable-
  instrument requirements) or via Civ. R. 1002 best-evidence.
- **Authentication** — affidavits of "custodian" employed
  by the debt buyer (not the original creditor) routinely
  fail Civ. R. 803(6) / 901 foundation. *LVNV Funding, LLC
  v. Henderson*, 2018-Ohio-3535 (1st Dist.) is the leading
  cite for affidavit-of-debt failures in Ohio.
- **FDCPA counterclaim** — 15 U.S.C. § 1692e (false
  representations) and § 1692f (unfair practices) are
  routine counterclaim grounds.

### 2. Original-creditor action

Plaintiff is the bank that issued the card or made the
loan (Capital One, Discover Bank, etc.) — not a debt buyer.

**Core defenses:**
- **SOL** — 6 years on written contracts under R.C.
  2305.06; 4 years on Ohio UCC Article 3 negotiable-
  instruments suits under R.C. 1303.16.
- **Account-stated** — original creditor's monthly
  statements can establish account-stated if undisputed for
  reasonable time.
- **TILA / Reg Z** — billing-error disputes raised within
  60 days under 15 U.S.C. § 1666 must be honored.
- **Choice of law** — many card agreements choose
  Delaware, South Dakota, or Virginia. Choice-of-law clause
  may shift the controlling SOL and interest cap.

### 3. Medical debt action

Plaintiff is a hospital system or its assignee.

**Core defenses:**
- **No-Surprises Act** — federal NSA limits balance-billing
  for out-of-network emergency care.
- **R.C. 1751.60** — Ohio prohibits HMO-contracted
  providers from billing enrollees beyond copays.
- **Reasonable-value challenge** — medical debt is contract
  for services; charges must reflect reasonable value if no
  agreed price.
- **R.C. Chapter 3727** hospital-debt rules.

### 4. Auto-deficiency action

Plaintiff is auto-finance company after repossession.

**Core defenses:**
- **Commercially reasonable sale** — UCC R.C. 1309.610(B)
  requires commercially reasonable disposition. *Coxson v.
  Commonwealth Bank*, 43 Ohio App.3d 31, is leading cite.
- **Notice of disposition** — R.C. 1309.611 requires pre-
  sale notice to debtor; failure to give notice bars or
  reduces deficiency under R.C. 1309.626.
- **Retail Installment Sales Act** — R.C. Chapter 1317
  (`oh-law-references/references/oh-statutes-debt/RC-Chapter-1317.md`):
  most auto financing is a retail installment contract, so
  RISA's contract-form and notice/cure requirements apply on
  top of Article 9.
- **Lien perfection on the title** — R.C. Chapter 4505
  (`RC-Chapter-4505.md`); the security interest is perfected
  by notation on the certificate of title (R.C. 4505.13).
  Test whether the plaintiff actually holds a perfected,
  properly assigned interest.
- **Insurance / GAP credit** — verify any GAP insurance was
  applied before deficiency calculated.

### 5. Garnishment / supplemental proceedings

Default judgment already entered; plaintiff is now
collecting via wage garnishment, bank attachment, or
debtor exam.

**Core defenses:**
- **R.C. 2329.66 exemptions** — Ohio personal property
  exemption is generous (wildcard $1,475; tools of trade
  $2,800; household goods $13,400; homestead $161,375 as
  of 2024 adjustment). Ohio uses state exemptions, not
  federal Bankruptcy Code exemptions.
- **CCPA garnishment cap** — 15 U.S.C. § 1673 caps wage
  garnishment at 25% of disposable earnings or amount above
  30x federal minimum wage.
- **R.C. 2329.07** — judgment dormant after 5 years if not
  executed upon; revival required.

## Ohio CSPA — the centerpiece counterclaim

The **Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act** (R.C. Chapter
1345) is the Ohio analog of the federal FDCPA + Washington's
CPA and is **substantially more powerful** than the federal
FDCPA on its own.

### Coverage

- **R.C. 1345.01(A)** defines "consumer transaction" — sale
  / lease / assignment / award / other transfer of an
  item / service to an individual for personal / family /
  household use.
- **R.C. 1345.01(C)** defines "supplier" — a seller,
  lessor, assignor, or other person engaged in the business
  of effecting consumer transactions. **Debt collectors and
  debt buyers are "suppliers" within the CSPA** per *Brown
  v. Liberty Clubs, Inc.*, 45 Ohio St.3d 191 (1989), and
  *Celebrezze v. United Research, Inc.*, 19 Ohio App.3d 49.

### Prohibited acts

- **R.C. 1345.02** — unfair / deceptive acts in connection
  with a consumer transaction.
- **R.C. 1345.03** — unconscionable acts.
- **OAC 109:4-3-XX** — Attorney General's substantive
  regulations adding per-industry prohibitions; debt-
  collection-specific rules at **OAC 109:4-3-11**.

### Damages

- **R.C. 1345.09(A)** — actual damages.
- **R.C. 1345.09(B)** — election of remedy: (1) triple
  actual damages, OR (2) $200 per violation. **Three times
  damages with no cap is the headline.**
- **R.C. 1345.09(F)** — **attorney's fees are mandatory**
  on prevailing-consumer CSPA judgments where supplier
  acted knowingly. *Bittner v. Tri-County Toyota*, 58 Ohio
  St.3d 143 (1991) is the leading fee-award standard
  (lodestar with Ohio modifications).

### SOL

- **R.C. 1345.10(C)** — 2 years from occurrence of
  violation OR from rescission becoming impossible /
  inapplicable.
- This is **2-year, not 6-year** — common pitfall.

## Federal overlays

The federal layer applies in parallel:

- **FDCPA** (15 U.S.C. §§ 1692-1692p) — applies to all
  third-party debt collectors (debt buyers, collection
  agencies, attorneys collecting consumer debt). Original
  creditors collecting their own debt are excluded.
- **Reg F** (12 C.F.R. Part 1006) — CFPB's 2021 codified
  rules: 7-7-7 contact limit, validation notice, time-of-
  day restrictions.
- **FCRA** (15 U.S.C. §§ 1681-1681x) — credit-report
  furnisher rules; § 1681s-2(b) provides private right of
  action after dispute via CRA.
- **TCPA** (47 U.S.C. § 227) — robocall + autodialed-text
  restrictions; collection calls within scope.

## Chain of title — debt-buyer defense backbone

Every debt-buyer plaintiff must prove unbroken chain from
original creditor. Build the discovery plan around:

### What to demand

1. Original cardmember agreement signed by consumer.
2. All monthly statements covering the account life.
3. Each Assignment / Bill of Sale in the chain (typically:
   original creditor → debt-buyer-warehouse → plaintiff;
   sometimes 3-4 hops).
4. Account-level data file accompanying each Bill of Sale
   (the actual transaction record proving THIS account was
   in the portfolio sold).
5. Affidavit of seller-side custodian at each hop (not just
   buyer's custodian).
6. Power-of-attorney chains where applicable.

### Common failures

- **Generic Bill of Sale** without account-level data file.
- **Custodian affidavit from buyer** purporting to
  authenticate seller's records — fails Civ. R. 803(6) /
  901.
- **Missing intermediate assignment** (Citibank → CCS Inc.
  → LVNV → Resurgent, but only CCS→LVNV produced).
- **Account-level data with discrepancy** in charge-off
  date, charge-off balance, or last-payment date.

## Discovery playbook

The `oh-discovery` skill covers the procedural framework.
Subject-specific:

- **RFP bank for debt buyers** — request the chain
  components above.
- **RFA bank** — request admissions on each foundation
  element (authenticity, custody, completeness).
- **Interrogatories** — Ohio Civ. R. 33(A) caps at 40
  including subparts; allocate carefully.
- **Motion to compel** — Civ. R. 37; require meet-and-
  confer per Civ. R. 37(E).
