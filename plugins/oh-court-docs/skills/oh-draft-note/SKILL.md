# Draft an Ohio Notice of Hearing

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Ohio uses "Notice of Hearing" — not
> NY's "Notice of Motion" or WA's "Note for Motion Docket."

## When you need a Notice of Hearing

After filing a motion, most Ohio Common Pleas courts
require the movant to **schedule the hearing with chambers
or the assigned magistrate** and then file a Notice of
Hearing. Procedure varies by court:

- **Cuyahoga County** — court issues the hearing notice via
  case-management order; movant rarely files a separate
  notice
- **Franklin County** — movant calls chambers, gets a
  date, and files Notice of Hearing
- **Hamilton County** — court schedules ex parte; movant
  files a request via the court's website
- **Summit County** — varies by department

Always verify per-court Loc. R. and chambers practice.

## Standard Notice of Hearing form

```
IN THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS OF [COUNTY], OHIO

[Plaintiff Name],                Case No. [CV-NNNNN]
                                  Judge: [Name]
        vs.
                                  NOTICE OF HEARING
[Defendant Name],

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that [Movant's] Motion to [Relief]
will be heard before [Judge / Magistrate Name] on
[Day, Date], at [Time], in Courtroom [Number].

                                  Respectfully submitted,

                                  __________________________

CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE
[Service text]

## Service requirements

- File the Notice with the court
- Serve copy on every party in the case (Civ. R. 5)
- File certificate of service

## Summary-judgment-specific notice

Civ. R. 56(C) requires **14 days' advance notice** of the
hearing on a motion for summary judgment. The notice
period runs from service of the motion + notice to the
hearing date. Civ. R. 6(D) adds 3 days for mail service.

## Order to Show Cause variant

Where the movant needs **expedited relief** (e.g.,
emergency protective order, TRO), Civ. R. 65 allows an
Order to Show Cause / Notice of Hearing combined. The
court signs the order; movant serves it; the responding
party must appear to show cause why the relief should not
be granted.
