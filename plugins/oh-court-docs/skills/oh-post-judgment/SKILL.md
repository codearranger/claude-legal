# Ohio Post-Judgment Procedure

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Post-judgment relief in Ohio is
> deadline-strict. Verify the specific clock that applies
> to your motion (Civ. R. 59 vs. 60(B); 28-day vs. 1-year).

## Motion to vacate / for new trial

### Civ. R. 60(B) — relief from judgment

Five grounds, with strict deadlines:

- **(1) Mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
  neglect** — must be filed within a **reasonable time but
  not more than 1 year** after the judgment
- **(2) Newly discovered evidence** — 1-year cap; must
  show evidence could not have been discovered earlier with
  due diligence
- **(3) Fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of
  an adverse party** — 1-year cap
- **(4) The judgment is void** — reasonable-time only (no
  1-year cap); typically jurisdictional defects
- **(5) Any other reason justifying relief** — catch-all;
  reasonable-time only

### Civ. R. 59 — new trial

- **28 days** from entry of judgment under Civ. R. 59(B)
- Grounds at Civ. R. 59(A) include irregularity in
  proceedings, misconduct of jury, accident or surprise,
  excessive or inadequate damages, error of law, judgment
  not sustained by the weight of evidence

## Judgment enforcement — R.C. Chapter 2329

### Statute of limitations

- **R.C. 2329.07** — 5 years to enforce a money judgment
  (Ohio judgments dormant after 5 years unless renewed by
  motion). Compare to NY's 20-year SOL — Ohio's enforcement
  window is much shorter and requires active renewal.

  2329.06 et seq.; writ of execution from court clerk;
  county sheriff serves

  notice + hearing right
- **Garnishment of bank accounts** — R.C. 2716.11 et seq.;
  affidavit of judgment-creditor + service on bank
- **Lien on real property** — recording the certificate of
  judgment in the county where the property is located
