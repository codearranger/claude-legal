# Pro Se Drafting Framework — Ohio

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Ohio pro-se litigants face the same
> procedural rules as represented parties (Ohio Civ. R. + per-
> court local rules). The court does not relax standards for
> self-represented filers. For complex matters, or matters with
> substantial sums at stake, consider consulting a licensed
> Ohio attorney.

## Signature block (pro se)

```
Respectfully submitted,

[Your full legal name]
Pro Se
[Address]
[City, State ZIP]
[Phone]
[Email]
```

Important conventions:

- **Designate "Pro Se" or "Self-Represented"** below your
  name. Some Ohio courts use "Pro Per" or
  "Self-Represented Litigant"; "Pro Se" is universally
  accepted.
- **Omit the attorney registration number** (don't make one
  up — Civ. R. 11 sanctions for false attestations).
- **Email is recommended** even for paper filings — Ohio
  courts increasingly serve via email after appearance.
- **No "Esq."** suffix.

## Affidavit form (not "declaration")

Ohio civil practice uses **affidavits** under R.C. 2319.04
and Civ. R. 56(C). The federal-style "declaration under
penalty of perjury" (28 U.S.C. § 1746) is **not** Ohio
practice for state-court filings.

Required elements of an Ohio affidavit:

1. Caption
2. Statement of affiant's competency: "I [name], being
   first duly sworn, state as follows:"
3. Numbered paragraphs of facts within personal knowledge
4. Closing: "FURTHER AFFIANT SAYETH NAUGHT."
5. Affiant's signature
6. **Notarization** — Ohio affidavits require a notary
   public's acknowledgment (or, in limited circumstances,
   another officer authorized to administer oaths under R.C.
   147.07)

If notarization is impractical, Ohio Civ. R. 56(C) allows
unsworn "declarations under penalty of perjury" pursuant to
the federal-style statement in **certain limited Civ. R. 56
contexts**, but the safer practice for any Ohio filing is
the notarized affidavit.

## Tone conventions

- Professional + factual; no ALL CAPS shouting; no emotional
  language
- Number each paragraph in the body of a motion or affidavit
- Use complete sentences in caption, body, and prayer for
  relief
- Refer to yourself as "Plaintiff" / "Defendant" /
  "Petitioner" / "Respondent" depending on role; some pro
  se filers refer to themselves in the first person ("I,
  John Smith, ...") — both are accepted
