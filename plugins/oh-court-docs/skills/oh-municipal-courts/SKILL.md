## Civil Division procedure

### Jurisdictional cap

- Single claim **≤ $15,000** — Municipal Court has
  jurisdiction
- Single claim **> $15,000** — Common Pleas exclusive
- Counterclaims may exceed $15,000 only on transfer to
  Common Pleas (R.C. 1901.22)

### Procedural framework

- Ohio Civ. R. applies generally
- Loc. R. of the specific Municipal Court overlays
- 28-day answer clock under Civ. R. 12(A)(1) applies
- Magistrate practice (Civ. R. 53) used in most courts

## Small Claims Division (R.C. Chapter 1925)

The Small Claims Division is the **principal pro-se forum
in Ohio**:

- **$6,000 maximum claim** (R.C. 1925.02)
- **No formal pleadings** — written statement of claim on
  court-provided form
- **No counsel required** for natural persons; **counsel
  required** for limited-liability entities (R.C. 1925.17)
- **No discovery** under Civ. R. 26-37 (R.C. 1925.03);
  parties exchange information at the hearing
- **Magistrate hearing** typically within 30-45 days of
  filing
- **Right to trial de novo** in the Civil Division if
  dissatisfied with the small-claims result (R.C. 1925.10)
- **Default judgment** entered if defendant fails to
  appear

## Consumer-debt collection in Municipal Court

Ohio Municipal Courts handle the **vast majority of
consumer-debt collection cases** in the state given the
$15k cap fits most credit-card and consumer-finance
balances:

- Debt-buyer plaintiffs file in Municipal Court whenever
  possible (avoids Common Pleas jury demands)
- Default judgments common against pro-se defendants who
  don't answer within 28 days
- The Ohio CSPA (R.C. Chapter 1345) applies in full —
  debt-collection conduct that's "deceptive" or
  "unconscionable" is actionable under R.C. 1345.02 / .03
  with R.C. 1345.09 treble damages on willful violations

See `oh-consumer-debt` for the substantive bundle.

## Eviction practice — R.C. Chapter 1923

Forcible Entry and Detainer (F.E.D., commonly called
"eviction") is filed in Municipal Court (or County Court
in counties without Municipal Court). Procedure:

- **3-day notice to leave** (R.C. 1923.04) served on
  tenant
- **Complaint** filed in Municipal Court after 3-day
  period
- **First appearance** scheduled within 30 days
- **Restitution of premises** writ issues if tenant
  defaults or loses
- **Damages judgment** in a separate proceeding (Second
  Cause of Action)

See `oh-family-law` for related domestic-violence-
related housing protections that intersect with eviction
practice.

## Filing flow

1. **Complaint** + **$45-$80 filing fee** (varies by
   court)
2. **Service** by certified mail through the clerk or by
   personal service
3. **Answer** within 28 days under Civ. R. 12(A)(1)
   (default judgment if missed under Civ. R. 55)
4. **First appearance / pretrial** typically 30-60 days
   from filing
5. **Magistrate hearing** if contested; bench trial if
   appealed
