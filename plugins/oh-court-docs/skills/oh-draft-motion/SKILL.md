## Standard Ohio motion structure

1. **Caption** — Civ. R. 10(A) format (see
   `oh-statewide-format`)
2. **Notice line** — `NOW COMES Defendant [Name], by and
   through undersigned counsel / Pro Se, and moves the
   Court for [relief sought], for the reasons stated in
   the attached Memorandum in Support.`
3. **Memorandum in Support** — typically with:
   - I. Statement of the Case
   - II. Standard of Review
   - III. Argument (with point headings)
   - IV. Conclusion / Prayer for Relief
4. **Certificate of Service** — Civ. R. 5
5. **Tendered proposed order** — separate document

## Common Ohio motion types

### Civ. R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss

- Standard: complaint fails to state a claim upon which
  relief can be granted under the plausibility framework
  (Ohio's analog of *Twombly*/*Iqbal*)
- Treats well-pled factual allegations as true
- Citation: *Mitchell v. Lawson Milk Co.*, 40 Ohio St.3d
  190 (1988) (12(B)(6) treats well-pled allegations as
  true); *Ogle v. Ohio Power Co.*, 70 Ohio St.3d 134
  (1994)

### Civ. R. 12(C) motion for judgment on the pleadings

- After pleadings are closed
- Court considers only the pleadings + attached exhibits
- *State ex rel. Midwest Pride IV, Inc. v. Pontious*, 75
  Ohio St.3d 565 (1996)

### Civ. R. 56 motion for summary judgment

- **14-day minimum notice** under Civ. R. 56(C)
- Movant must show no genuine issue of material fact
- Standard: *Dresher v. Burt*, 75 Ohio St.3d 280 (1996)
  (moving party bears initial burden; non-moving party
  then must point to specific facts in the record)
- Supporting evidence: affidavit, pleadings, discovery
  responses, transcripts under Civ. R. 56(C)

### Civ. R. 60(B) motion to vacate

- See `oh-post-judgment` for the five grounds + deadlines
- Citation: *GTE Automatic Electric, Inc. v. ARC
  Industries, Inc.*, 47 Ohio St.2d 146 (1976) (three-part
  test: (1) timely motion; (2) meritorious defense if relief
  is granted; (3) one of the five 60(B) grounds)

### Civ. R. 37 motion to compel

- Grounds: failure to respond to interrogatories, RFPs,
  RFAs, or to appear at deposition
- Meet-and-confer required by most Loc. R.
- Attorney's fees recoverable under Civ. R. 37(A)(4)

## Memorandum sections

### I. Statement of the Case

Concise factual + procedural posture. 1-3 paragraphs.

### II. Standard of Review

For each motion type, cite the controlling standard
(12(B)(6) plausibility; 56 *Dresher*; etc.).

### III. Argument

Point headings stating affirmative propositions. Each
section ties facts (citing affidavit ¶ or exhibit) to
legal authority (Ohio Civ. R., R.C., or Ohio appellate
case in public-domain format).

### IV. Conclusion / Prayer for Relief

Specific relief sought. Mirror the tendered proposed
order.

## Local-rule page limits

Common Pleas page limits vary materially:

- **Cuyahoga** — typically 20 pages for motion brief
- **Franklin** — typically 25 pages
- **Hamilton** — typically 25 pages
- **Summit** — typically 20 pages

Always verify per-court Loc. R. before drafting; longer
briefs may require leave of court.
