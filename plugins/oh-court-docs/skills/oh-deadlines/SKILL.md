# Ohio Case Deadlines

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Deadlines are jurisdictional in
> many contexts (Civ. R. 60(B) 1-year cap, App. R. 4 30-day
> appeal). Always verify with the case-management order
> and per-court Loc. R.

## Time computation framework

### Civ. R. 6(A) — basic rule

- Exclude the day of the triggering event
- Include the last day, unless it falls on Saturday,
  Sunday, or a legal holiday, in which case **roll forward
  to the next business day**
- Periods of less than 7 days exclude intermediate
  weekends and holidays
- Service by mail adds **3 days** under Civ. R. 6(D)

### R.C. 1.45 — weekend rollover

Statutory deadlines that fall on Saturday, Sunday, or a
legal holiday roll forward to the next business day. This
parallels Civ. R. 6(A) for procedural deadlines.

## Ohio legal holidays (R.C. 1.14)

- New Year's Day (January 1)
- Martin Luther King, Jr. Day (3rd Monday in January)
- Washington's Birthday (3rd Monday in February)
- Memorial Day (last Monday in May)
- **Juneteenth (June 19)** — added 2024
- Independence Day (July 4)
- Labor Day (1st Monday in September)
- **Columbus Day (2nd Monday in October)** — Ohio still
  observes Columbus Day as a legal holiday
- Veterans Day (November 11)
- Thanksgiving Day (4th Thursday in November)
- Christmas Day (December 25)

Notable: Ohio does NOT observe the day after Thanksgiving
as a statewide legal holiday (some local Common Pleas
courts close on a discretionary basis).

## Service-by-mail add-on (Civ. R. 6(D))

When a paper is served by mail, the responding party gets
an extra **3 days** added to the response period. This
applies to most filings but NOT to motion deadlines under
some local rules — verify per-court.

## Computing deadlines — the script

# 6-year SOL on written contract
python3 case-calendar.py --from 2019-04-15 --rule sol-written-contract
