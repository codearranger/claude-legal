# Assemble an Ohio Court Filing Packet

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Filing protocols vary by Common
> Pleas court. Verify per-court Loc. R. before filing.

## E-filing landscape in Ohio

Most Ohio Common Pleas courts use **county-specific**
e-filing systems rather than a statewide platform:

- **Cuyahoga County** — eFiling portal at
  `cpdocket.cp.cuyahogacounty.us`
- **Franklin County** — `efile.fccourts.org`
- **Hamilton County** — Court Connect at
  `courtclerk.org`
- **Summit County** — eFiling via Tyler Technologies
- **Montgomery County** — eFiling portal
- **Most other Common Pleas courts** — Tyler Tech / Odyssey
  variants

Each portal requires registration. Pro-se filers can
register without an attorney bar number.

## Municipal Court e-filing

Ohio Municipal Courts run their own e-filing systems
(R.C. Chapter 1901 leaves the choice to each court). Some
larger Municipal Courts (Cleveland, Columbus) have
e-filing; smaller Municipal Courts may still require paper.

## Pre-flight checklist

Before submitting:

- [ ] Caption matches case-management order (court, case
      number, parties)
- [ ] Document title in ALL CAPS in the caption
- [ ] Filer's signature with Atty. Reg. # (or "Pro Se")
- [ ] Certificate of Service signed + dated
- [ ] All exhibits attached + labeled (Exhibit A, B, ...)
- [ ] Page limits per Loc. R. (verify)
- [ ] Proposed order tendered if motion (Civ. R. 12(A);
      most Loc. R. expect this)
- [ ] Format-check.py passes
- [ ] Quality-check passes (oh-quality-check)

## Per-court working copies

Some Common Pleas courts require courtesy paper copies for
the assigned judge:

- **Cuyahoga Civil Division** — some chambers require a
  bench copy for briefs over 15 pages
- **Franklin Civil Division** — varies by judge
- **Smaller Common Pleas courts** — typically no working
  copy required; e-file is sufficient

When working copies are required:

- Print double-sided unless court specifies single-sided
- Hole-punch (3-hole) for chambers binder if requested
- Deliver to bailiff or chambers within 1 business day of
  e-filing

## Certificate of Service (Civ. R. 5)

Required format:

```
                CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE

I certify that on [Date], a copy of the foregoing was
served upon all counsel of record / parties via [eFiling
system / U.S. mail / hand delivery / email] at their
addresses of record.

                            __________________________
                            [Filer's name]
```
