## Per-court scheduling protocols

### Cuyahoga County Common Pleas

- Most Civil Division motions: court issues hearing notice
  via case-management order
- For new motions outside the case-management schedule:
  contact the assigned judge's bailiff
- Cuyahoga Court of Common Pleas — bailiff phone numbers
  published on the court website
- Generally the court rules without oral argument on
  uncontested motions

### Franklin County Common Pleas

- Civil Division motion-day scheduling: call the assigned
  judge's chambers
- Magistrate hearings: call the assigned magistrate
- Civil Division motion practice often non-oral (decided
  on the briefs)

### Hamilton County Common Pleas

- Online scheduling for motion hearings via the court's
  case-management system
- Some judges require movant to email chambers a proposed
  date

### Other Common Pleas courts

- Procedure varies; verify per-court Loc. R. and chambers
  guidelines

## Magistrate-set hearings

For Civ. R. 53 magistrate proceedings:

- Magistrate's bailiff schedules the hearing
- Notice goes out to all parties
- 14-day objection clock after the magistrate's decision
  is filed

## Notice-of-Hearing flow

After scheduling:

1. Confirm date + time + courtroom with chambers / bailiff
2. Draft Notice of Hearing (see `oh-draft-note`)
3. File the Notice with the court
4. Serve the Notice on every party (Civ. R. 5)
5. File certificate of service

## Civ. R. 56(C) summary-judgment notice

When the motion is for summary judgment, Civ. R. 56(C)
imposes a **14-day minimum** between service of the motion
and the hearing. Civ. R. 6(D) adds 3 days for service by
mail.
