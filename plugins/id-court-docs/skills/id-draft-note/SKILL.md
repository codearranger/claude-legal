  This skill should be used to scaffold an Idaho Notice of Hearing
  — the document that places a motion on the court's calendar for
  hearing — and the related party-filed notices in Idaho civil
  practice. In Idaho the scheduling document is the Notice of
  Hearing under I.R.C.P. 7(b)(3); the moving party serves and files
  it at least 14 days before the hearing. Triggers include "Idaho
  notice of hearing", "set a motion for hearing Idaho", "I.R.C.P.
  7(b)(3) notice", "notice a hearing Idaho", "draft a notice of
  hearing for my motion", "14-day notice Idaho motion", "schedule
  my Idaho motion for hearing". Composes with `id-statewide-format`
  for the caption, `id-schedule-hearing` for obtaining or
  coordinating the date, `id-deadlines` for the 14-day count and
  service add-ons, and `id-draft-motion` for the underlying motion.

# Draft an Idaho Notice of Hearing

In Idaho civil practice, a motion is set for hearing by a **Notice
of Hearing**. The scheduling mechanism is governed by **I.R.C.P.
7(b)(3)**: the moving party files and serves the Notice of Hearing,
and the **notice and motion must be served and filed at least 14
days before the hearing**. Idaho's scheduling document is the
Notice of Hearing — not a "Note for Motion Docket" or a
freestanding "Notice of Motion".

## I.R.C.P. 7(b)(3) — the 14-day notice rule

Under **I.R.C.P. 7(b)(3)**, the moving party serves and files the
**Notice of Hearing** that sets the motion for hearing:

- The **notice and motion must be served and filed at least 14
  days before the hearing**. Confirm the current day count in
  `id-law-references` and compute the actual date with
  `id-deadlines`, which applies **I.R.C.P. 2.2** time computation
  (Rule 6 is reserved) and the **+3 days for service by mail**.
- **Summary judgment is the exception.** A motion for summary
  judgment under **I.R.C.P. 56** runs on a longer track — the
  motion is served at least **28 days** before the hearing and the
  answering brief at least **14 days** before — so the Notice of
  Hearing for a Rule 56 motion must respect that track. Confirm the
  current figures in `id-law-references`.

Do **not** hard-code response/reply day counts here. Confirm the
briefing schedule and any notice-period figures in the current text
of the rule via `id-law-references`, and compute dates with
`id-deadlines`.

## Who sets the date — venue matters

How a motion hearing date is obtained varies across Idaho courts
and judicial assignments. In many courts the filer **contacts the
judge's clerk or the trial-court administrator** to obtain an
available date before preparing the Notice of Hearing; some courts
run standing motion calendars. Whether a matter is heard in the
**Magistrate Division** or the **District Court** also affects the
calendaring channel.

- **Use `id-schedule-hearing`** for obtaining or coordinating the
  date with the court before the Notice of Hearing is prepared.
- **Check the venue overlay** — `id-ada`, `id-bonneville`,
  `id-county-courts`, `id-family-court` — for the local practice on
  who sets the date and how it is communicated.
- Appearance method (in person vs. remote/telephonic) is set by the
  court and the assigned judge's practice.

## Certificate of service — I.R.C.P. 5

Service of the motion and the Notice of Hearing on every other
party is governed by **I.R.C.P. 5**, and a **certificate of
service** is required for papers served after the complaint. The
filing must state the date, manner, and recipients. E-filing
through iCourt (I.R.E.F.S.) constitutes consent to e-service;
confirm the current service manners (including electronic service)
in **I.R.C.P. 5** and the I.R.E.F.S. rules via `id-law-references`.
