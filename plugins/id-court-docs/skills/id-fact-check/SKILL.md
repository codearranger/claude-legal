# Fact-Check Idaho Court Filings

Use this skill before any Idaho court filing leaves the desk. It
runs four passes. It is the deeper evidentiary-citation pass;
`id-quality-check` is the lighter format-and-content pass. This
skill points at the canonical corpora rather than embedding statute
text or section numbers — pull current text from `id-law-references`.

## Pass 1 — Citation verification

For every rule, statute, and case citation, verify:

- **Rule cited**: exists in the correct Idaho rule set and says what
  the brief claims. Confirm the subdivision against current text via
  `id-law-references`. Idaho uses Rule-number plus
  lettered/numbered subparts (e.g., I.R.C.P. 56(a), I.R.C.P.
  7(b)(3)). The civil rules are **I.R.C.P.**, evidence is **I.R.E.**,
  and appellate rules are **I.A.R.**
- **Statute cited**: exists at the cited section. Idaho statutes are
  the **Idaho Code — Idaho Code § NN-NNN** (or **I.C. § NN-NNN**).
  Confirm against `id-law-references`; flag any section the brief
  invented or mis-numbered. Confirm limitations periods against
  current text rather than memory.
- **Federal statute cited**: exists at the cited subsection (e.g.,
  FDCPA at 15 U.S.C. § 1692 et seq.). Pull from the federal corpus.
- **Case cited**: exists; the reporter citation is correct; the
  proposition stands for what the brief claims; the case has not been
  overruled. Use **CourtListener** (Idaho Supreme Court = `idaho`,
  Court of Appeals = `idahoctapp`) and the connected CourtListener
  MCP to confirm the case is real and read the holding.

### Idaho citation format checks

Idaho cites to the **official Idaho Reports** together with the
**Pacific Reporter**. Idaho has **no neutral / public-domain
citation** — do not invent a vendor-neutral cite. Verify each
against current usage via `id-law-references`:

- Case form: `[Party A] v. [Party B], [###] Idaho [###], [###]
  P.[2d/3d] [###] ([YEAR])` — a **comma** separates the official
  Idaho Reports and the Pacific Reporter citations; keep the periods
  in `Idaho`, `P.2d`, `P.3d`, and `v.`
- Example: *Fitzgerald v. Walker*, 113 Idaho 730, 747 P.2d 752
  (1987).
- **Court of Appeals** opinions add a court parenthetical:
  `..., [###] Idaho [###], [###] P.3d [###] (Ct. App. [YEAR])`.
  Verify whether a cited opinion is a Supreme Court or Court of
  Appeals decision and that the parenthetical matches.
- Statutes: `Idaho Code § 9-1406` or `I.C. § 9-1406` (keep the `§`).
  Rules: `I.R.C.P. 56(a)`, `I.R.E. 803(6)`, `I.A.R. 14`.
- Flag a missing `§` on statutes, dropped periods in reporter
  abbreviations, a wrong parallel-cite separator, or a missing
  "(Ct. App. YEAR)" on a Court of Appeals case as a format WARN.

## Pass 2 — Internal consistency

Within a single document, verify:

- **Party names**: each party named consistently throughout (and in
  `v.` form in any case caption); party **designations** match the
  forum (Plaintiff/Defendant vs. Petitioner/Respondent).
- **Case number**: appears identically wherever it recurs, and
  matches the court named in the caption (District Court / Magistrate
  Division).
- **Dates**: every date is consistent across all appearances (date of
  service, date of contract, date of last payment, date judgment was
  entered). A deadline that runs from a stated date must be supported
  by that date.
- **Dollar amounts**: every amount is consistent and the totals add
  up (principal + interest + fees + costs = total demanded).
- **Defined terms**: any term defined with `(the "Account")` is used
  consistently (no slipping into "the loan" or "the debt").
- **Cross-references**: every "see paragraph X" or "see Exhibit Y"
  resolves to a real location.
- **Numbered paragraphs**: sequential without gaps or duplicates.

## Pass 3 — Packet consistency

Across the multi-document packet (motion + Memorandum + supporting
affidavit/declaration + Notice of Hearing + proposed order +
certificate of service):

- **Caption identical** in every document: court, county, party
  names, and case number must match exactly.
- **Document title** matches between the motion, its certificate of
  service, the Notice of Hearing, and the proposed order's title.
- **Dates align**: the certificate-of-service date should match the
  signature date on the motion; an affidavit's jurat date or a
  declaration's execution date should align with when it was made;
  the hearing date in the Notice of Hearing respects the **14-day**
  (or Rule 56 **28-day**) lead time.
- **Relief sought matches**: the motion's prayer must mirror the
  proposed order's decretal language item by item.
- **Exhibits** referenced in the motion are described in the
  affidavit/declaration and physically attached (exhibits are part of
  the pleading under I.R.C.P. 10).
- **Signature / Bar number**: each signed document carries the
  signer's signature and, for an attorney, the **Idaho State Bar
  number**; a self-represented filer signs without one.

## Pass 4 — Sworn vs. argued

Compare what is sworn-to in the supporting affidavit/declaration
against what is argued in the motion or Memorandum:

- Every **factual assertion** in the argument should be (a) supported
  by a citation to a paragraph of the affidavit/declaration, (b)
  admitted in the pleadings, or (c) a matter of judicial notice.
- Identify any factual claim in the brief **not** supported by the
  affidavit/declaration — a gap to fix before filing.
- Identify any sworn fact **not used** in the brief — consider
  whether it belongs in the affidavit at all.
- Verify the affidavit/declaration's **personal-knowledge
  foundation** and, for a business-records affidavit, that it
  satisfies the custodian / qualified-witness requirement of **I.R.E.
  803(6)** and any self-authentication under **I.R.E. 902** (verify
  the exact 902 sub-paragraph numbering against current text). Flag
  paragraphs that begin "I believe" or "I understand" without a
  foundation.
- Confirm an **unsworn declaration** carries the **Idaho Code
  § 9-1406** "under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
  Idaho" subscription and a date, or the affidavit carries a
  completed jurat.

## Output format

When invoked on a packet, produce a structured verification report:

```
FACT-CHECK REPORT — [Document title / Case number]

Pass 1 (Citations)
  PASS  I.R.C.P. 56(a)                    — exists; correct subpart
  WARN  Idaho Code § 5-216                — confirm written-contract
        limitations period against current Idaho Code text
  FAIL  Smith v. Jones, 999 Idaho 1       — not found on CourtListener
        (idaho / idahoctapp); verify the case is real
  WARN  Fitzgerald v Walker, 113 Idaho    — Bluebook uses periods:
        730                                "Fitzgerald v. Walker"; add
                                           parallel P.2d cite

Pass 2 (Internal consistency)
  PASS  Party names + case number consistent
  WARN  Paragraph numbering jumps from 6 to 8

Pass 3 (Packet consistency)
  PASS  Caption matches across motion, declaration, proposed order
  FAIL  Notice of Hearing date is only 9 days after service — short
        of the I.R.C.P. 7(b)(3) 14-day lead

Pass 4 (Sworn vs. argued)
  FAIL  Memo p.3 asserts "the collector held a license"; no
        corresponding declaration paragraph

Summary: 6 PASS / 3 WARN / 3 FAIL — DO NOT FILE until FAILs resolved.
