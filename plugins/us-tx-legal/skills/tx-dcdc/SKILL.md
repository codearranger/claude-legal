Use this skill in addition to `tx-statewide-format` when the matter
is a **civil** case in the **Dallas County District Courts**, one of
the largest trial-court systems in Texas, sitting in **Dallas**.

## The court

Texas's general-jurisdiction trial court is the **District Court**.
Dallas County has a large bench of **numbered District Courts** —
each a separate court with its own number and elected judge (for
example, the "192nd Judicial District Court of Dallas County,
Texas"). The Dallas County District Courts are organized into
divisions:

- **Civil District Courts** — general civil litigation, with no upper
  jurisdictional dollar limit; contract, tort, debt, real-property,
  and injunctive matters.
- **Family District Courts** — divorce, SAPCR, and related
  domestic-relations matters. Route family matters through
  `tx-family-court`.
- (Criminal District Courts handle felonies and are outside this
  civil-drafting skill.)

A civil action is captioned in the **[Nth] Judicial District Court of
Dallas County, Texas** — see `tx-statewide-format` for the full
caption with the **§** divider.

## Case assignment and the central jury system

Dallas County administers its civil District Courts through a
county-managed **case-assignment** and **central jury** system: a new
civil case is filed with the District Clerk and assigned to a District
Court, which manages it to disposition, while jurors are drawn through
a centralized jury operation. Confirm the current assignment and
trial-setting mechanics — including how a case is set for trial and
how emergency/ancillary relief is heard when the assigned court is
unavailable — with the clerk and the Dallas County local rules before
relying on them.

## Local rules

Practice in these courts is governed by the **statewide Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure (TRCP)** and **Texas Rules of Evidence (Tex. R.
Evid.)**, as supplemented by the **Dallas County (Civil District
Courts) local rules** and each judge's standing orders / court
procedures. The local rules and standing orders address civil case
management, scheduling / docket control orders, motion-setting and
oral-hearing practice, and chambers-copy requirements.

Do not hard-code rule numbers, page limits, or motion-setting
mechanics from memory — read the current Dallas County local rules
and the assigned court's standing orders in `tx-law-references` (or
confirm with the clerk and the court's website) before relying on
them.

## E-filing — the Dallas County District Clerk and eFileTexas

The **Dallas County District Clerk** maintains the district-court
record and intakes filings. Electronic filing runs through the
statewide **eFileTexas.gov** portal (Tyler Technologies **Odyssey
File & Serve**), under **TRCP 21(f)** and **Tex. R. Jud. Admin. 10**:

- **E-filing is mandatory for attorneys** in civil matters in the
  District Courts.
- **Self-represented filers may e-file** through eFileTexas.gov and
  are encouraged to; confirm whether the clerk also accepts paper
  filing from a self-represented party.
- The **civil case information sheet (TRCP 78a)** accompanies the
  initial filing of an original petition.

Confirm the current document-type selections, the filing-fee /
fee-waiver workflow (a **Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of
Court Costs** may apply), and any local cover-sheet requirement
before assembling a packet. See `tx-file-packet`.

## Case management and scheduling

After the case is filed and answered, the assigned court manages it
through a **scheduling / docket control order** setting discovery
deadlines tied to the **TRCP 190 discovery level**, dispositive-motion
dates (note the **TRCP 166a** summary-judgment timing — motion served
at least **21 days** before the hearing, response due **7 days**
before, and Texas's distinct **no-evidence** motion under 166a(i)),
and the trial setting. **Calendar your obligations from the
scheduling order entered in your specific case**, and confirm the
assigned judge's individual procedures and any chambers-copy
requirement. See `tx-schedule-hearing`, `tx-hearings`, `tx-discovery`,
and `tx-deadlines`.

## Cause-number conventions

A Dallas County civil cause number follows the county's pattern
(commonly a year/case-type designation plus a sequential number, with
a court designation assigned at intake). **Confirm the exact
cause-number format and the assigned court** the District Clerk gives
your case; once assigned, the cause number and the assigned court
anchor the caption per `tx-statewide-format`. Do not guess the format
— verify it against the clerk's intake.

**Agent behavior:** before drafting a Notice of Hearing, setting a
page-limited motion, or calendaring a deadline, read the current
Dallas County local rules and the assigned court's standing orders in
`tx-law-references`, the scheduling order entered in the case, and the
assigned judge's procedures. Confirm the civil-vs-family division, the
eFileTexas document-type selection, and any chambers-copy requirement
with the clerk.
