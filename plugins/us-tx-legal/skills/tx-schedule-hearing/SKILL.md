# Reserve a Hearing or Submission Setting (Texas)

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** This skill helps plan how to reserve a setting
> and draft the contact record. The procedure varies by court and by
> the assigned judge — verify the filing court's local rules, the
> assigned judge's procedures, and current coordinator / clerk /
> eFileTexas practice before relying on anything here.

In Texas, the typical mechanic is **reserve the setting first, then
notice it.** A party generally **coordinates an available setting**
with the **court coordinator** (district and county courts) or the
**precinct clerk** (justice courts), and then files and serves a
**Notice of Hearing** under **Tex. R. Civ. P. 21** stating that
setting. The motion and notice must be served respecting the **Rule
21(b)** notice floor (and the longer **Rule 166a** 21-day track for a
summary-judgment motion) — back the reservation out from that floor
and from the briefing schedule. See `tx-hearings` and `tx-deadlines`.

## Submission or oral hearing — decide before you call

Decide whether the motion will be decided **by submission** (on the
papers, with a submission date) or **by oral hearing** (argument on a
date and time) before contacting the court — many courts default
routine motions to the **submission docket** and reserve oral
argument for dispositive or evidentiary motions. The court's local
rules and the assigned judge's practice control. See `tx-draft-note`.

## Who sets the setting — by court level

How a setting gets reserved depends on the court:

1. **District Courts and County Courts at Law — the court
   coordinator.** Each court has a **court coordinator** (the judge's
   calendar staff) who controls the docket. You contact the
   coordinator (by phone or email, or through the court's online
   setting system where one exists) for an available oral-hearing date
   or to confirm the submission-docket procedure. Some courts run a
   periodic submission docket on which motions are set by filing the
   Notice of Submission by a cutoff.
2. **Justice Courts (JP courts) — the precinct clerk.** Setting is
   handled through the **precinct clerk / Justice of the Peace's
   office**. Justice-court procedure is simplified (Tex. R. Civ. P.
   500–510); confirm the precinct's setting practice with its clerk.
3. **eFileTexas.** Texas e-files through **eFileTexas.gov** (Odyssey
   File & Serve). Confirm whether the hearing/submission request and
   the Notice of Hearing flow through the portal or are coordinated
   directly with the coordinator/clerk.

Always confirm the venue's actual mechanism — some courts set
argument by order, some require you to email the coordinator for a
date, and submission-docket cutoffs vary.

## General workflow

The shape is: **reserve → notice → calendar.**

1. **Reserve the setting.** Contact the court coordinator (district/
   county) or the precinct clerk (JP) for an available date/time, or
   confirm the submission-docket cutoff, leaving the Rule 21(b) notice
   margin (or the Rule 166a 21-day margin) and accommodating the
   briefing schedule.
2. **File and serve the Notice of Hearing** stating the reserved
   setting, the appearance method (in person / Zoom / submission), and
   the response-due statement, filed with the motion. See
   `tx-draft-note`.
3. **Calendar backward** from the setting: the notice floor, the
   opposing party's response window, and the movant's reply. Compute
   with `tx-deadlines`.

> Sequence note: do **not** file a Notice of Hearing asserting a
> setting you have not confirmed with the court. Reserve first, then
> notice.

## When scheduling is initiated

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Motion ready; need an oral-hearing setting | Contact the court coordinator (district/county) for an available date; confirm the Rule 21(b) margin; route to the venue skill |
| Motion ready; submission docket | Confirm the submission-docket cutoff with the coordinator; file the Notice of Submission by the cutoff |
| Harris County matter | Follow the Harris County court coordinator / submission-docket procedure; see `tx-hcdc` |
| Dallas County matter | Follow the Dallas County coordinator procedure; see `tx-dcdc` |
| Other county | Court-coordinator setting is the norm; confirm the county's local rules; see `tx-county-courts` |
| Justice Court (JP) matter | Setting through the precinct clerk; confirm the precinct's practice |
| Family-law matter | Setting follows the family district court / associate-judge practice; see `tx-family-court` |
| Hearing set; need to continue / pass | Move (or agree) to continue with proposed dates per the coordinator's procedure; do not assume agreement alone moves the setting |
| Emergency / ex parte / TRO relief | Contact the coordinator immediately and follow the court's ex parte / Tex. R. Civ. P. 680 et seq. TRO procedure |

## Contact channels and scheduling systems

Channels differ by court and by individual judge / coordinator and
change at judicial rotation. **Do not cache or guess coordinator/clerk
phone numbers, email addresses, or portal URLs** — fetch the current
procedure from the filing court's website, its local rules, or the
assigned judge's published procedures. Texas courts e-file through
**eFileTexas.gov**; confirm whether the setting request and the Notice
of Hearing flow through the portal.

### Per-venue routing notes

Starting points only — each court's local rules and the assigned
judge's procedures control.

| Court | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Harris County (Houston) District / County Courts at Law** | Setting through the court coordinator; many courts use a submission docket. eFileTexas. Route to `tx-hcdc`. |
| **Dallas County District / County Courts at Law** | Court-coordinator setting; procedures differ by court. Route to `tx-dcdc`. |
| **Other counties** | Court-coordinator setting is the norm statewide; confirm the county's local rules. See `tx-county-courts`. |
| **Justice Courts (JP precincts)** | Setting through the precinct clerk; simplified Rule 500–510 procedure. |
| **Family district courts** | Setting follows the family court / associate-judge practice. See `tx-family-court`. |

## Producing the contact record

Produce the **scheduling contact email or call log** to memorialize
the reservation:

```
Subject: Hearing/Submission Setting Request — [Case Short Title],
         Cause No. [Number]

To: Court Coordinator, [Nth] Judicial District Court / County Court
    at Law No. ___, [County] County

I am the [Plaintiff / Defendant], self-represented, in the above
matter. I intend to file and notice a [Motion to ___] under
Tex. R. Civ. P. 21 and request [an available oral-hearing date on or
after [DATE] / a submission setting on the next available submission
docket], allowing the Rule 21(b) notice period [or the Rule 166a
21-day period for a summary-judgment motion]. I estimate the hearing
will take approximately [N minutes]. Please advise an available
setting and whether the appearance is in person, by Zoom, or on
submission.

Thank you,
[Name] / [Phone] / [Email]
```

Keep a parallel **call log** for any phone contact (date / time,
person spoken to, court, setting offered, appearance method). Keep all
contact to pure scheduling logistics.

> **Avoid ex parte communication** with the court on anything beyond
> pure scheduling logistics, and include the opposing party when
> coordinating availability where the court expects it.

## Scheduling-request plan

Produce a short plan capturing, for the chosen venue:

- The reserved (or requested) setting date/time (or submission date),
  and the **time estimate** stated.
- Confirmation that the setting leaves the **Rule 21(b)** notice
  margin (or the **Rule 166a** 21-day margin) and accommodates the
  briefing schedule.
- The appearance method (in person / Zoom / submission) and where the
  setting confirmation will arrive (coordinator email / eFileTexas /
  mail).
- The response and reply windows backed out from the setting so the
  motion is fully briefed beforehand (compute with `tx-deadlines`).
- A log of any scheduling contact, kept to pure scheduling logistics.

## Hearing-length estimation guidance

A realistic time estimate helps the coordinator find a slot.

| Motion / event | Typical estimate |
|---|---|
| Tex. R. Civ. P. 91a motion to dismiss | 20-45 min |
| Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a summary judgment | 30-60 min |
| Special exceptions (Rule 91) | 15-30 min |
| Discovery / motion to compel (Rule 215) | 15-30 min |
| Motion for new trial (Rule 329b) | 20-45 min |
| TRO / temporary injunction (Rule 680 et seq.) | 30-180 min (often evidentiary) |
