  This skill should be used to scaffold a Texas Notice of Hearing —
  the document that sets a motion for an oral hearing or for
  submission and places it on the court's calendar. In Texas civil
  practice the scheduling document is the Notice of Hearing; the
  setting is obtained from the court coordinator (district and
  county courts) or the precinct clerk (justice courts), and the
  motion and notice are served on all parties under Tex. R. Civ. P.
  21/21a. Triggers include "Texas notice of hearing", "set my motion
  for hearing Texas", "set my motion on submission Texas", "notice
  of submission Texas", "draft a notice of hearing for my motion",
  "TRCP 21 notice of hearing", "submission docket Texas", "get my
  Texas motion heard". Composes with `tx-statewide-format` for the
  caption, `tx-schedule-hearing` for obtaining the setting from the
  court coordinator, `tx-deadlines` for the notice count and service
  add-ons, and `tx-draft-motion` for the underlying motion.

# Draft a Texas Notice of Hearing

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** This skill scaffolds a notice document as a
> drafting aid. Verify the filing court's local rules and the
> assigned judge's practice — especially how a setting is obtained,
> the notice period, submission-vs-oral-hearing practice, and the
> certificate-of-service requirements — against current law before
> filing.

In Texas civil practice, a motion is placed on the court's calendar
by a **Notice of Hearing**. This is the document that **sets a
motion for hearing or for submission**. The filing and service of
the motion and its notice are governed by **Tex. R. Civ. P. 21** and
**21a**; the moving party files the notice with the clerk and serves
it on all parties.

## Submission vs. oral hearing — pick the setting

A Texas trial court may dispose of a motion in either of two ways,
and the **court's local rules and the assigned judge's practice
control**:

- **By submission** — the court rules on the papers, without oral
  argument. The Notice of Hearing states a **submission date**: the
  date by which responses are due and on or after which the court may
  rule. Most routine, non-evidentiary motions go on the **submission
  docket**.
- **By oral hearing** — the motion is set for argument on a date and
  time, in a courtroom or by remote appearance. Dispositive and
  evidentiary motions are commonly set this way.

Confirm which mode the assigned court uses for the motion type before
preparing the notice; some courts default everything to submission
unless oral argument is requested.

## Tex. R. Civ. P. 21(b) — the notice period

Under **Tex. R. Civ. P. 21(b)**, unless otherwise provided by these
rules or shortened by the court, a motion and notice of the hearing
on it must be **served at least three days before the time specified
for the hearing**. This is a **floor**, not a complete schedule:

- **Summary judgment is the exception.** A motion for summary
  judgment under **Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a** runs on a longer track —
  the motion and any supporting affidavits are served **at least 21
  days before** the hearing or submission date, and the response is
  due **7 days before** — so the Notice of Hearing for a Rule 166a
  motion must respect that 21-day track.
- Service by mail, commercial delivery, fax, or email adds **+3
  days** to a period that runs from service under **Tex. R. Civ. P.
  21a** — account for it when backing the setting out from the floor.

Do **not** hard-code response/reply day counts here. Confirm the
current notice-period and service-add-on figures in
`tx-law-references` and compute the actual dates with `tx-deadlines`.

## Who sets the setting — venue matters

How a setting is obtained varies by court level:

- **District Courts and County Courts at Law** — the filer typically
  contacts the **court coordinator** (the judge's calendar staff) to
  reserve an oral-hearing date or to confirm the submission-docket
  procedure, then prepares the Notice of Hearing reflecting that
  setting. Some courts have an online or standing submission docket.
- **Justice Courts (JP courts)** — setting is handled through the
  **precinct clerk / Justice of the Peace's office**; justice-court
  procedure is simplified and the regular notice mechanics may differ.

Use `tx-schedule-hearing` to obtain or coordinate the setting before
the Notice of Hearing is prepared, and check the venue overlay
(`tx-hcdc`, `tx-dcdc`, `tx-county-courts`, `tx-family-court`) for the
local practice on who sets the date and how it is communicated.

## Certificate of service — Tex. R. Civ. P. 21a

Service of the motion and the Notice of Hearing on every other party
is governed by **Tex. R. Civ. P. 21a**, and a **certificate of
service** is required. The certificate must state the date and manner
of service and the recipients. For those who e-file, e-service
through eFileTexas is the default method; confirm the current service
manners in `tx-law-references` and see `tx-file-packet`.
