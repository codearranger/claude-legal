# Texas Discovery

> **NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** This skill helps draft and respond to
> discovery. Verify against the current Texas Rules of Civil Procedure,
> the court's local rules, and any docket-control or scheduling order
> before serving or filing.

Use this skill alongside `tx-statewide-format`, `tx-law-references`,
and (where applicable) `tx-first-30-days`. The Texas civil discovery
framework lives in **TRCP 190–215** and applies in the District Court
and the County Courts at Law. (Justice-court discovery is sharply
limited and runs under TRCP Part V — see `tx-county-courts`.) Pull the
verbatim rule text from `../tx-law-references/references/court-rules/`
before serving or responding.

## Texas allows written interrogatories

Texas permits the full toolkit of party discovery — written
interrogatories, requests for production, requests for admission, and
depositions — without leave of court, subject to the limits of the
governing **discovery control plan**. The response window for written
discovery is generally **30 days** (with nuances noted below — confirm
the exact count and triggers against the corpus).

## ★ The discovery control plan — TRCP 190

Every Texas case is assigned to one of **three discovery levels** under
**TRCP 190**, and the level governs the discovery period and the limits
on each device:

| Level | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Level 1 — TRCP 190.2** | Expedited actions and certain other limited cases (tied to **TRCP 169**, for claims at or below the statutory ceiling). Tight discovery period and per-side limits — e.g., capped deposition hours, capped interrogatories. Confirm the current dollar ceiling and the per-side limits against the corpus. |
| **Level 2 — TRCP 190.3** | The **default** plan when no Level 1 or Level 3 plan governs. The discovery period runs for a set time keyed to the first deposition or the trial setting, with the standard per-side limits. |
| **Level 3 — TRCP 190.4** | A **court-ordered, tailored plan** — the parties or the court craft a docket-control order setting the discovery period, limits, and deadlines for the specific case (common in complex matters). |

> **Identify the governing level before serving anything.** The level
> sets the discovery-period cutoff and the numeric limits; serving
> beyond them without leave is objectionable. Pull the day counts and
> per-side limits for the operative level from the corpus.

### Expedited actions — TRCP 169

A suit for monetary relief **at or below the statutory ceiling**
(exclusive of interest, costs, and attorney fees — confirm the current
ceiling against the corpus) is an **expedited action** under **TRCP
169**, automatically on **Level 1** discovery, with a limited discovery
period, limited per-side discovery, and a trial-setting requirement.
Pleading a higher relief range removes the case from the expedited
track.

## Required disclosures — TRCP 194

**TRCP 194** requires **initial disclosures** without a discovery
request. Under the **amendment effective January 1, 2021**, disclosures
are now **automatic / initial-disclosure style** (modeled on the
federal approach): each party must, within the rule's window after the
first answer is filed, disclose the categories of information TRCP
194.2 lists — the parties' correct names, potential parties, legal
theories and factual bases, the amount and method of calculating
damages, witnesses, documents, insurance, and settlement agreements.
**Additional disclosures** for testifying experts (TRCP 194/195) and
pretrial disclosures follow on their own schedules. Confirm the current
window and the 194.2 list against the corpus.

## Requests for Production — TRCP 196

**TRCP 196** requests documents, electronically stored information
(ESI), and tangible things, and may seek **entry onto land** for
inspection. The responding party produces documents as kept in the
usual course of business or organized to correspond to the request's
categories, and responds within **30 days** after service (a party may
not serve RFPs before its own answer is due in some postures — confirm
the timing against the corpus). **ESI** is produced in a reasonably
usable form; address form-of-production and metadata by agreement,
consistent with TRCP 196.4 and the proportionality limits of TRCP 192.

## Interrogatories — TRCP 197

Written interrogatories to a party are governed by **TRCP 197**.

- **Numeric cap.** Under **TRCP 197.1** a party may serve **no more
  than 25 written interrogatories, excluding interrogatories asking a
  party only to identify or authenticate specific documents**, counting
  each discrete subpart as a separate interrogatory. (Levels 1 and 3
  may impose a different cap — confirm the operative limit and the
  subpart-counting rule against the corpus before serving a large
  set.)
- **Responses — 30 days.** Answers are served separately and fully, in
  writing under oath, within **30 days** after service (**TRCP
  197.2**), with each objection stated specifically. A responding
  party may answer by producing business records under **TRCP 197.2(c)**
  on the rule's conditions.

```
INTERROGATORIES

Pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 197, [Defendant] requests that [Plaintiff]
answer the following Interrogatories separately and fully, in writing
under oath, within 30 days after service.

INTERROGATORY NO. 1: State the name, address, and telephone number of
each person with knowledge of relevant facts, and describe the subject
of that knowledge.

ANSWER: [Response]
```

## Requests for Admission — TRCP 198

- **Critical — deemed admitted.** Under **TRCP 198.2(c)** a matter is
  **deemed admitted, without the necessity of a court order,** unless
  the responding party serves a written answer or objection within
  **30 days** after service. Calendar RFA deadlines carefully — a
  missed deadline can concede dispositive facts.
- A party may move to **withdraw or amend** a deemed admission under
  **TRCP 198.3** on the rule's conditions (the merits are served and
  the requesting party is not unduly prejudiced) — but do not rely on
  withdrawal; answer on time.

## Depositions — TRCP 199

- **TRCP 199** governs oral depositions; serve **reasonable** written
  notice of the time, place, and deponent (TRCP 199.2). The per-side
  deposition limits (hours / number) are set by the **discovery level**
  — confirm against the corpus.
- For an **organization deposition** under **TRCP 199.2(b)(1)**,
  describe the matters for examination with reasonable particularity so
  the entity can designate a witness.
- Depositions on written questions (TRCP 200), depositions to perpetuate
  testimony (TRCP 202), and non-party / out-of-state depositions
  (TRCP 201, 205) have their own mechanics — confirm in the corpus.
- Remote / video depositions are permitted; state the method on the
  notice.

## Scope and proportionality — TRCP 192

Discovery extends to any matter **not privileged that is relevant to
the subject matter** of the action, with the **proportionality** limits
of **TRCP 192.4** (a court may limit discovery that is unreasonably
cumulative, obtainable more conveniently elsewhere, or whose burden
outweighs its likely benefit). Privileged matter and work product are
protected; assert a privilege expressly and serve a **withholding
statement / privilege log** under **TRCP 193.3**.

## Self-authentication of produced documents — TRCP 193.7

> **Useful in debt and contract cases.** Under **TRCP 193.7**, a
> document a party **produces in response to written discovery is
> authenticated** for use against that party in any pretrial proceeding
> or at trial — **unless**, within **10 days** (or a longer or shorter
> time the court allows) after the producing party has actual notice
> that the document will be used, the party objects to authenticity and
> states the specific basis. Confirm the current notice/objection
> window against the corpus. This rule lets a party use the opponent's
> own produced records without a sponsoring witness, and a debt
> defendant should watch the objection clock when a debt buyer produces
> account records.

## Motion to compel and sanctions — TRCP 215

If a party fails to respond, responds evasively, or lodges improper
objections, move to compel under **TRCP 215** (specifically TRCP 215.1
for the motion to compel and TRCP 215.2 for failure to comply with an
order). Texas conditions discovery relief on a good-faith effort to
resolve the dispute, and the motion should:

1. **Identify the specific deficiencies** (which interrogatory / RFP /
   RFA / disclosure, and why the response is inadequate).
2. **Attach** the requests and responses as exhibits.
3. **State a certificate of conference** describing the good-faith
   attempt to resolve the dispute without court action.
4. **Address each objection** on the merits.
5. **Request specific relief**: an order compelling responses by a date
   certain, plus an award of reasonable expenses.

```
Subject: Certificate of Conference re: Discovery Responses —
         [Case Short Title], Cause No. [Number]

[Name], this is my good-faith effort to confer under Tex. R. Civ. P.
215 before I file a Motion to Compel. Your responses to my First Set
of Interrogatories and Requests for Production, served on [DATE], are
deficient as follows:

  1. Interrogatory No. 3 — Boilerplate objection without specifying the
     vague term or quantifying the burden.
  2. Request for Production No. 7 — No documents produced though the
     petition references documents within this request.
  3. Request for Admission No. 2 — Evasive non-answer.

Please supplement by [date]. If I do not hear from you, I will proceed
with a Motion to Compel and seek expenses under Rule 215. [Name]
```

A motion to compel is set for hearing or submission — see `tx-hearings`
and `tx-schedule-hearing`.

### Sanctions ladder

- On a granted motion to compel, **TRCP 215.1** authorizes an award of
  the reasonable **expenses, including attorney fees**, caused by the
  failure, unless the resistance was substantially justified.
- For **disobedience of a discovery order**, **TRCP 215.2** escalates
  to stronger sanctions — up to striking pleadings, deeming matters
  established, prohibiting evidence, dismissal, or default judgment
  (the most severe "death-penalty" sanctions require the conduct and
  the sanction to be appropriately matched).
- **TRCP 215.4** addresses the consequences of failing to admit under
  Rule 198, and **TRCP 193.6** can exclude evidence not timely
  disclosed.

Verify the current subpart lettering against the verbatim TRCP 215 text
in `../tx-law-references/references/court-rules/`.
