# Harris County District Courts (Houston)

Use this skill in addition to `tx-statewide-format` when the matter
is a **civil** case in the **Harris County District Courts**, which
sit in **Houston** and form the largest trial-court system in Texas
by caseload.

## The court

Texas's general-jurisdiction trial court is the **District Court**.
Harris County has a large bench of **numbered District Courts** —
each a separate court with its own number and elected judge (for
example, the "234th Judicial District Court of Harris County,
Texas"). The Harris County District Courts are organized into
divisions:

- **Civil District Courts** — general civil litigation, with no upper
  jurisdictional dollar limit; contract, tort, debt, real-property,
  and injunctive matters.
- **Family District Courts** — divorce, SAPCR (suits affecting the
  parent-child relationship), and related domestic-relations matters.
  Route family matters through `tx-family-court`.
- (Criminal District Courts handle felonies and are outside this
  civil-drafting skill.)

A civil action is captioned in the **[Nth] Judicial District Court of
Harris County, Texas** — see `tx-statewide-format` for the full
caption with the **§** divider.

## Central docket / random assignment

Harris County uses a **central-docket** model: a new civil case is
filed with the District Clerk and **randomly assigned** by the clerk
to one of the civil District Courts, which then manages the case
through disposition. There is also an **ancillary docket** that hears
time-sensitive matters (temporary restraining orders, temporary
injunctions, and other emergency relief) when the assigned court is
unavailable. Do not assume which court will hear an emergency
application — confirm the current ancillary-docket / emergency-relief
procedure with the clerk and the local rules before noticing
emergency relief.

## Local rules

Practice in these courts is governed by the **statewide Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure (TRCP)** and **Texas Rules of Evidence (Tex. R.
Evid.)**, as supplemented by the **Harris County (Civil Trial
Division) local rules** and each judge's standing orders / court
procedures. The local rules and standing orders address civil case
management, docket control / scheduling orders, motion-setting and
oral-hearing practice (including any submission-docket vs. oral-
hearing distinction), and chambers-copy requirements.

Do not hard-code rule numbers, page limits, or motion-setting
mechanics from memory — read the current Harris County local rules
and the assigned court's standing orders in `tx-law-references` (or
confirm with the clerk and the court's website) before relying on
them.

## E-filing — the Harris County District Clerk and eFileTexas

The **Harris County District Clerk** maintains the district-court
record and intakes filings. Electronic filing runs through the
statewide **eFileTexas.gov** portal (Tyler Technologies **Odyssey
File & Serve**), under **TRCP 21(f)** and **Tex. R. Jud. Admin. 10**:

- **E-filing is mandatory for attorneys** in civil matters in the
  District Courts.
- **Self-represented filers may e-file** through eFileTexas.gov and
  are encouraged to; confirm whether the clerk also accepts paper
  filing from a self-represented party.
- The **civil case information sheet (TRCP 78a)** accompanies the
  initial filing of an original petition.

Confirm the current document-type selections, the filing-fee /
fee-waiver workflow (a **Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of
Court Costs** may apply), and any local cover-sheet requirement
before assembling a packet. See `tx-file-packet`.

## Case management and scheduling

After the case is filed and answered, the assigned court manages it
through a **docket control order / scheduling order** setting
discovery deadlines tied to the **TRCP 190 discovery level**,
dispositive-motion dates (note the **TRCP 166a** summary-judgment
timing — motion served at least **21 days** before the hearing,
response due **7 days** before, and Texas's distinct **no-evidence**
motion under 166a(i)), and the trial setting. **Calendar your
obligations from the docket control order entered in your specific
case**, and confirm the assigned judge's individual procedures and
any chambers-copy requirement. See `tx-schedule-hearing`,
`tx-hearings`, `tx-discovery`, and `tx-deadlines`.

## Cause-number conventions

A Harris County civil cause number follows the county's pattern
(commonly a year prefix plus a sequential number, with a court /
case-type designation assigned at intake). **Confirm the exact
cause-number format and the assigned court** the District Clerk
gives your case; once assigned, the cause number and the assigned
court anchor the caption per `tx-statewide-format`. Do not guess the
format — verify it against the clerk's intake.

**Agent behavior:** before drafting a Notice of Hearing, setting a
page-limited motion, or calendaring a deadline, read the current
Harris County local rules and the assigned court's standing orders in
`tx-law-references`, the docket control order entered in the case, and
the assigned judge's procedures. Confirm the civil-vs-family division,
the eFileTexas document-type selection, and any chambers-copy
requirement with the clerk.
